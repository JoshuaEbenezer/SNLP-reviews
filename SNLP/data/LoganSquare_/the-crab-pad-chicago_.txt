My boyfriend and I had reservations for A different crab place, but I felt guilty spending that much on dinner soooo I made him cancel lol. We found ourselves here and we couldn't have been happier!The service was on point. Our waiter was always checking in on us and making sure our cups were always filled. We decided to order 1 lb of crab with potatoes & corn in the crab pad style. It was delicious. It did have a slightly sweet after taste, but still tasty. We always ordered 2 lbs of shrimp. One was lemon pepper with corn and the other was garlic with potatoes. Both flavors were so good. I think we ended up leaving with about 1/2-1 lb of the shrimp. We ended our meal with a Popsicle! We loved all the interesting flavors they had. We ended up with a ube drizzled with white chocolate, sweetened condensed milk and Oreo. This one was our favorite!!! Tasted like French vanilla, but prettier. We also went with a Vietnamese coffee drizzled with sweetened condensed milk and graham crackers. This one tasted exactly as if you were drinking an iced coffee. It was good, but don't think I'd order it again. We can't wait to go back and dig in again! Cracking the crab legs was so fun.

Having grown up in the south but now temporarily relocated to Chicago for school, I was SO PUMPED to finally have good Cajun food again. With limited stomach real estate, I highly recommend the garlic noodles, crawfish (Crab Pad sauce!!), and the build-your-own-popsicle dessert bar. First things first, the garlic noodles are just a great garlicky and buttery start for appetizers. I would definitely recommend splitting it so you can save room for the seafood and dessert though!As for the crawfish in the signature Crab Pad sauce, that was BOMB; it's a mixture of lemon pepper, Cajun, and garlic butter, so you know it's going to be good. We ordered it in medium spice (very tolerable if you like spicy food), and I found myself licking up the sauce after all the crawfish was gone. The only downside is that you can only order in 1-lb increments, so no 1/2-lb orders are allowed.Last but not least, save room for dessert! Inside The Crab Pad, Milk & Wood has a cute popsicle bar with several Asian-inspired flavors. On our visit, there was taro (ube), green teae Kit Kat, and Thai tea - just to name a few. The Thai tea was definitely the winner though especially when drizzled with condensed milk!Service (4/5)Very attentive service! Our waitress patiently explained the ordering process and helped us out with recommendations. To save time, I'd recommend you ask them to bring you the shellfish shell cracker in advance so you can get on with the nom noms ASAP! They also take reservations!Atmosphere (5/5)The Crab Pad is primarily table and booth seating. Overall, the space is very clean \u00a0and has a casual, cute vibe to it, making it ideal for a fun night out with family and friends.Overall, highly recommend The Crab Pad! It's a cute treasure that stands on its own compared to southern crawfish boils, and the popsicles are a wonderful way to end the meal!

This wasn't my fav seafood boil. Other than the corn, which was steamed beyond perfectly, their boils are borderline subpar. I've tried them twice. Each time I felt the same way. A few things stuck out. 1. The sauce is more grease than a blend of supposedly delicious ingredients. 2. \u00a0The sausage...I absolutely do not recommend. It was gummy, undercooked, and very difficult to chew. After figuring out what was going on with the first one I tried to eat, I abandoned all the rest at the bottom of the bag. 3. Potatoes are tiny. Apparently, as I was told when I walked in the second time, they take one potato (both times for me, a small potato) and cut it into 3 pieces. \u00a0You'll probably need more than 1 set of (3). I found the base sauce attempt to be ok. I could see where they were trying to go with it. The issue is that both times I've had this place, the sauce was overwhelmed by grease.I'll probably not be back here. There are plenty of other places that do seafood boils much better.

Better because my group of 3 ladies went for the snow crab and Dungeness crab with a pound of headless shrimp crab pad style medium spice. Added on 2 potato orders(think one red skinned potato each) and 3 orders of corn(think a small half corn on the cob), 3 biscuits. Started with sweet potato fries. We shared this and had room for ice cream too. The spice definitely compounds as you eat through the delicious mix. You'll want the plastic bib and don't forget it's BYOB. We were definitely full so we opted not to add hot noodles to the remaining sauce. But you totally should if you've never tried it!First time around my group of 3 wanted to order solo (2 guys and me) and since you have to order a pound it's not as fun since I can't eat a pound of shrimp on my own. This is a place to share and get messy for sure. Milk and wood ice cream bars are so worth the $5 splurge. Homemade ice cream dressed with any toppings you like.

She always came by to check up on us and asked if we needed anythingFood: We had 4lbs of seafood (2 lbs of whole shrimp, 1 lb mussels, and 1 lb crawfish). We did all the seasonings and medium spicy. The medium spicy was just right in our opinion. We were very surprised how big the mussels were. Normally at other crab boils it's fairly small. We also ordered garlic noodles and oh my!! So good! I want to go back to try out more of the sides that they had. Also I was curious of the Hot noodles that you can add to your bag. I'll try it out next time. I believe the noodles soak up all the oil/seasonings on the bottom of your bag that you can eat..YUM! The ice cream was a must since it was our first time. We loved it!

He was super friendly and informative. Anything that we needed, he was there. Now, I had the headless shrimp, on medium, with all three of their seasoning flavors mixed, noodles and potatoes in the bag. I swapped with my friend who did the snow crab legs. We were told that medium/mild wasn't hot, but my sinuses would beg to differ. By the end of dinner, we were all sniffing and trying to cool our mouths down. It was so good, we didn't want to stop though! We STUFFED our faces like there was no tomorrow! I love how you could taste the seasoning all through the meat, noodles, and potatoes. There are some places where the outside of what you're eating contains the flavorings and nothing else! The friends that I went with also mentioned how it's so different from Angry Crab where you almost feel rushed to eat your meal and finish. We got to lounge and linger and event sign the wall.

We got a pound of crawfish, headless shrimp and lobster tail. Also ordered a side of the garlic noodles. My favorite was the headless shrimp.

It's basically like Angry Crab, but with better service, better quality food, no wait, and the best part: customized ice cream! I came here with a couple of friends on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner. It's in Logan Square, so parking wasn't hard at all. The staff was very welcoming as we were seated right away since we came early (5pm). Our waitress was very friendly and walked us through the menu and how the restaurant works (many places do things differently) but it was basically the same as the other restaurants like Angry Crab or Asian Cajun. All the reviews talked about how great the garlic noodles were, so I ordered them as an appetizer. Definitely worth it!! Garlic and parmesan goodness. I'll definitely order this again next time. For $8, we were given a pretty large portion so it's worth it. I was happy to see that crawfish was available even though it wasn't in season. I ordered a pound of snow crab legs and a pound of crawfish in crab pad style (all sauces combined) and in spicy. The crab pad style sauce tasted identical to Angry Crab's trifecta sauce, but without all the excess butter.. I loved it!! It also came with whole cloves of garlic--another huge plus. I have a high tolerance to spicyness, and the spicy was just perfect for me. The crawfish was a little salty, but that was expected since it wasn't in season. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp, they were huge. We were really happy with the way things turned out. In the corner was a Milk & Wood ice cream pop bar. What I liked about it the most was that they had different flavors rather than the traditional ones like vanilla or chocolate. From what I remember, there was Green Tea Kit Kat, Thai Tea, Cookies and Cream, and more. I got the cookies and cream, and topped it with dark chocolate, mixed nuts, and oreos. SO GOOD! But pretty messy, so be sure to eat over the paper boat. Again, this place is probably the closest thing to Angry Crab, but I'd definitely prefer this place.

The crab meat was very tender and enjoyable, this is coming from someone who actually isn't a huge fan of seafood. Corn and sausages were in the bag with the shrimp, slathered in sauce and very flavorful. The garlic noodles were likely my favorite. They were cooked just right, not too soft, but still tender. The only thing I'd say about the noodles are that they were a bit too oily. What I was least impressed with was the shrimp. Majority of the shrimp were boiled well, but I'd say maybe 1 in every 3 shrimp felt overcooked and the texture was a tad soggy.

It's a unique experience and BYOB which makes it even better. I'm giving the 5 star here because this is truly a spot you can go regularly and have a great time, while enjoying consistently delicious food. Price wise seeing the per-pound numbers seemed like it would be a lot, but the sides are much less and the total comes to a very reasonable amount. And without buying drinks the price is brought down even more. So out the door after you have a long, interesting, great experience and it comes out to maybe $40 a person. This great value is my support for the high rating here. For food we had the king crab and shrimp. These came in the same bag and were lathered in the house seasoning and butter. I would say the shrimp were slightly better, but both were really tasty. The crab could have been a bit meatier but I wasn't complaining. A pound of shrimp and crab was a perfect amount for two people to split (assuming you get some sides)Onto the sides.. I read all the reviews to get the garlic noodles and was very skeptical because they just looked like buttered noodles in a basket. And as this was true, the dish was awesome. I would come back again just for this alone. Not sure what they did to make buttered noodles so good but the prior reviews proved accurate.. The fish and chips were also great. We got sweet potato fries with that instead of normal fries. I suggest doing that. Noodles and fish&chips, in recap, were a meal alone I'd return for. Oh and the dessert bar was very solid. I loved the strawberry cheesecake flavor. The people I was with got some of the fruit flavors and they were not as crazy about them. So stick with simple ice cream flavors here.

I found my new favorite spot for seafood in a bag! I've heard so many good reviews about this place so I'm glad I tried it out because I'll definitely be coming back. It's definitely on my top 3 list along with Angry Crab and lowcountry.Parking: paid street parking in the front, very easy to find parking Ambience/Space: the space is pretty big, with a popsicle bar at the front and plenty of tables. The sink is in the middle on the restaurant. Menu: the menu is typical of all seafood in a bag restaurants. You can choose from mussels, shrimp, crawfish, clams, crab legs, etc. Choose your sauce (garlic butter, lemon pepper, Rajun Cajun, and crab pad, which is a combination of all flavors) and last, choose your level of spicy (mild, medium, or spicy). You can also add extra add ons like sausage, corn, or potatoes. I ordered my usual shrimp and clams with mild garlic butter sauce and my boyfriend ordered crawfish and shrimp with spicy Crab Pad sauce. They recommended ordering a pound of food per person but my boyfriend and I were so hungry and ordered 2 lbs each! They even asked if we wanted our food to be separated into separate bags and I liked that they put all of my food in 1 bag. I absolutely loved the garlic butter sauce omg I couldn't stop eating it! The texture of the sauce was thick and flavorful and I loved that the flavor clung onto the seafood. They even gave us a little cup for us to scoop the sauce so we can dip our seafood in the cup full of sauce yay. My boyfriend loved that the Crab Pad sauce was flavorful as well with the garlic and it was spicy as he wanted it to be. For dessert, there's a popsicle bar where you can choose a flavor for your popsicle like Thai Tea or Matcha and for a $1 more, add unlimited toppings. I ordered the Thai Tea popsicle with sprinkles, Oreo, and white chocolate sauce yum! The popsicles are $5.Service: the waitress was super nice and helpful. She explained the concept and the menu. She even helped with the bib haha and gave us markers to write on the wall. Food came quickly and she was refilling our water and came by to ask if we needed anything. Great service!Verdict: this place is on my top 3 seafood in a bag places in Chicago. I love their sauces and the seafood was cooked perfectly. I also like the customized popsicle bar! The bill came around $60 for 2 people (depending on what you order) but this is typical for my experiences with seafood in bag restaurants.

I personally believe that it all started in Los Angeles with Boiling crab because every single one of the restaurants that i've been to here in Chicago are almost exact replicas of the Boiling Crabs back at home. Even the bib is the same. That wont deter me from giving each new restaurant a shot though. We came on a Thursday evening, the location is literally right across the street from our apartment. My friend and I who frequently eat this type of food together always go for the exact same order. We do 3 lbs of head on shrimp, we personally love ripping the heads off and sucking out all the juices! 2 lbs of crawfish with four corns and sausages. A basket of cajun fries and always the garlic noodles. Each restaurant has a different name for the seasoning.. I personally know it as the whole shebang which is the crab pad for them. Its basically a combination of all their sauces together which in my opinion is always the best. We always get medium spicy as well! So the fries come out.. pretty typical. Crispy fries tossed with cajun seasoning. I usually like to take the ketchup bottle and write or draw fun things onto the parchment paper. Oh also disclaimer.. be prepared to get dirty and also DO NOT WEAR WHITE ANYTHING! The food comes completely prepared in bags filled with your order and doused in their house sauce. I always ask for tons of limes and also ask for a little plastic cup filled with salt and pepper. So what you do is squeeze a bunch of limes into the cup with salt and pepper and it makes for a perfect dipping sauce to your seafood. This place by far has the best tasting sauce i've tried to date in Chicago. It had the perfect ratio of spices and butter. It's the closest thing i've tasted to the locations I eat back home. Most of the seafood tasted fresh, the crawfish were also nice and meaty. Honestly the best part of the whole experience is the corn. The corn which has soaked in that delicious sauce whilst you been peeling and working hard to eat your shellfish. The corn is seriously heavenly. The only reason this place gets 4 stars for me is because I felt that some of the shrimp that we had eaten were undercooked, soggy and mushy. Usually implying that there was an issue with preparation or the shrimp wasn't too fresh. I mean i'm sure most the shrimp starts frozen, so it could've just been some bad ones of the bunch. Do order the garlic noodles, they are fantastic. Rich, buttery, and garlicky goodness. Peel some shrimp and throw them on top of the noodles.

They have ice buckets for the alcohol you bring and they also carry around bottle openers. FOOD: The sauce is delicious!! Market price was 12.99/lb for shrimp which is comparable to California prices. We opted for the sauce that had combo of everything in it with sausage and corn. The sauce was flavorful, rich, not too oily, and with a hint of sweetness. My bf thinks it's better than the sauce in boiling crab, you can judge that for yourself but I would say it's pretty amazing. He liked it so much he ended up bringing the leftover sauce home too.DESSERT: The case of popsicles entices you once you walk into the room. There are an abundance of unique flavors such as green tea kit-kat, thai ice tea etc. It's an extra $1 for unlimited toppings. The presentation is not as nice as pop bar in California but I still enjoyed the flavors. It's a little pricey so I would say 1 bar is enough for 2 people to share. SERVICE: All the servers have great humor and are very attentive. I would say almost too attentive because sometimes you just want to eat your shrimp in peace.PARKING: There is an abundance of street parking outside the area and we had no troubles at all even on a Friday night.

I'd been to The Angry Crab, and Asian Cajun, in Chicago a few times, so I was really pumped to have something in my hood. So, luckily, I was able to check them out during their soft open with 4 other friends, and I was not disappointed.Here's what I recommend:- The Crab Pad style, with medium spice. The medium spice was just right for us. I like spice, but when you are eating bags of seafood, with sauce running down your hands and face, trust me, that spice gets amplified. The got the garlic butter, with mild spice, which was good, but the Crab Pad style was where it's at. I'd recommend about 1.5 - 2 lbs per person, not counting the add-on items. - Get it with lime wedges on the side, and you will not be disappointed. They give you little sauce cups which you can scoop out the sauce to dip it in for a little extra flavor, and squeeze a lil lime on there, and man. So good.- It's BYOB. So do yourself a favor and swing by Hopewell and grab yourself a growler to go with the seafood. Revolution would suffice as well.- We really liked the mussels, the headless shrimp, the snow crab, the dungeness crab. We also got the king crab and the clams, and they were good but we preferred the former (And it feels weird to just recommend everything we ordered). The crawfish and lobster weren't available at the time, so we weren't able to get that.- Get the corn. So good. I always hate when it gets stuck in my teeth, but the corn was sweet, and just came off the cob. The sausage, and potatoes were good additions as well.- Order some apps. The seafood takes a little time to cook, so it's nice to have something to munch on while you wait. The garlic noodles were good. The garlic fries were okay. Also, you can get the rice to go with the seafood... It's a good base to absorb all the flavors.- I also liked that you could have a bunch of different stuff in each bag, where Asian Cajun will have each item separate. My buddy always likes to have the crawfish as a base for the flavor, but I could go either way.Things I'd like to see:- If you're not into rice, some rolls woulda been a real nice addition to the menu.- Oh man, if they had cornbread, that'd be the bomb.- I was gonna say wet wipes, but they got these hand washing stations, which is so key!- Not sure if it's warm in there, or if we were really feeling the spice level... But then again, it kinda feels right that it should be warm in there. Also, the food comes out pretty hot, so watch those fingies!Anyway, the service was super good. Our server, Jenny, helped explain to my friends who'd never been to a seafood boil place before what the deal was. The other runners were good about keeping our water glasses filled (but I had beer, so I didn't even need it). The kitchen I think was still getting this straightened out, because they accidentally had swapped the sauces we wanted in the two different orders, but it wasn't a big deal for us. All in all, I don't think I could ask for a better time there.Okay, this turned into a way longer review than I intended.

Bland ranch and weird sweet-smoky orange stuff? \u00a0Nope. We didn't finish a lot of the apps. The cajun fries, sweet potato fries, and garlic noodles are good...But notice that they are the only things on the app menu that have garlic? \u00a0Hmmmm, maybe flavor and spices actually do make a difference? But come on, $8 for buttered garlic noodles?? \u00a0They're not THAT great, they're just the most flavorful thing on the app menu. $8 for a paper boat of noodles is ridiculous. The $10 fish & chips comes with 3 pieces of rectangular frozen battered fish in various sizes. They don't offer any vinegar or lemon wedges, the tartar sauce seemed commercially made. The bags of (frozen) seafood were okay, but there was SO much garlic butter sauce, it was impossible to actually taste the meat. I got the Blue Crab and managed to get a few pieces out of the legs. Not worth the mess IMO, but our group got into it. \u00a0I felt so gross after eating and, while i was thankful that I could at least wash my hands immediately, the sink in the middle of the room is awkward AF. The other thing that bothered me was how much WASTE there is at this place! \u00a0Everything is disposable!! Paper covers on the tables, rolls of paper towels, plastic bibs, plastic utensils, plastic cups for water/beverages, paper boats for all the apps, and DOUBLE plastic bags for the seafood. \u00a0Gross. The piles of garbage alone make me never want to come back here. Also, not being able to split checks is annoying. Sorry, Crab Pad.

Seen this concept on Instagram and always wanted to try it out! Food: -We weren't sure how much to order as it comes by the lb. So I ordered a lb of Crawfish (first time trying) and Snow Crab legs. My friend ordered Snow Crab and the Garlic Noodles. -Our waitress Allegra was super helpful in recommendations and how to order. They have four options for sauces, and she recommended Crab Pad Style. You can also choose the level of spice you want but we just stuck with mild. It was flavorful and you could taste it with every bite. It's served in a bag and the sauces pool at the bottom so extra for dipping.-I left full and with probably a half a lb. of Crawfish left. He finished everything and was full as well. -This concept is super messy, so I wouldn't wearing your nicest attire, but you get a bib and napkins. It's so fun and makes for a better experience!Service:-Greeted at the door, checked on not only by our waitress but by others, napkins replenished, asked if we needed anything/how everything tasted multiple times. Very good customer service established from the beginning and I think that alone will help make this place a hit! Miscellaneous:-Fun decor, and you can draw on the walls. There is a barrel close to bathroom is a station set up to wash your hands! Humorous neon sign to take a picture with! Only recommendation is that it needs a little air flow, whether it be fans or AC, I was a little toasty. -It's not as expensive as I was expecting for that much seafood!Will definitely make my way out there again!", "user_name": "Alexis J.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NohSnffkkucTAmj_9N2fnQ"}, {"review_date": "8/26/2016", "review": "NOM NOM NOM!

I am only giving it 4 stars because the service was very awkward.

For dessert, we went to the Popsicle bar were you pick your flavor of Popsicle and what toppings you want. We both had the coffee which had a great flavor and not too overpowering.

Came out piping hot and the pasta was not soggy at all. A little bit of sweetness. Highly recommend even though it's $8.Shrimp with garlic butter mild: MUST get. The shrimp was bouncy and meaty. Dip it again in the sauce and lime. I also felt that you got the biggest bang for your buck with the shrimp. This was actually so good that we ordered another pound.Crawfish with Rajun Cajun medium: My second fav. Note that the medium spicy wasn't really that spicy.Clams with everything sauce medium: Although I liked the flavor of this one and the clams were good, we found a lot of empty shells and not a lot of clam meat.King crab legs: The meat itself was delicious, BUT this was A LOT of work. I consider myself a pretty damn pro at opening crab legs, but I had to WORK for this one. I wish they precrack it for us. Next time, I won't be ordering this cause it was just NOT worth the effort. #foreverlazyRice: We ordered rice and it was super hard, dry, and parts were even crunchy. We told the server and she agreed. We still got charged for it though.Mango Tea Lemonade: Super yummy and refreshing. Nice to wash down all the butter.Green Tea Kit Kat popsicle: There is a popsicle stand that has its own register. You can walk up to order and add to your tab if you want.

My husband and I decided to try this place since it's in our neighborhood. We really enjoyed The Angry Crab and we heard this was similar. Unfortunately, we were horribly mislead! Both the concept and menu are pretty similar, but the quality doesn't even compare. We ordered the headless shrimp, snow crab legs, and mussels in the medium spiciness Crab Pad style sauce. There was very little sauce in the bag, and the sauce that was provided was not very good. It was extremely oily with with more pepper than anything else- not nearly as good as The Angry Crab! The shrimp were smaller and not very flavorful, the crab legs were a decent size, but the mussels were horrible. Right away we noticed that there was something sticking out of the mussels that closely resembled a wad of hair, so we brought it to the waitress's attention. She had no idea what it was either, so she picked up one of our mussels and ran back to the front desk. There, the entire staff proceeded to gather around a screen while they googled this nasty thing. About 10 minutes later a man, who presumably was an owner, came over and assured us that it was natural. He said that it was called a mussel beard. We've never seen one of these things, and for good reason-they're supposed to be removed from the mussel BEFORE they're eaten. Instead of saying, \"the chef made a mistake while cleaning and the mussels are on us,\" they made us think that we were crazy to not scarf down every last one. The man did offer to get us a replacement, so we ordered shrimp again. We didn't have to pay for the shrimp, but we did have to pay for the mussels (SERIOUSLY???). Now I don't want to sound super dramatic. I wasn't expecting our entire meal to be comped, but it did seem like a poor business practice to make an unhappy client pay for a crappy dish. To top it off, a woman, who we assumed was the other owner (perhaps wife?), then came over and jokingly asked us if anything was crawling out of our meal. While I can appreciate the joke, it was really poor timing especially given that we were paying good money for \"our meal,\" which a few moments ago did have something coming out of it... \u00a0I think my rant is now over.

I have to say, as a former server, they cleared our messy-ass butter and garlic filled table without hesitation. This is my first yelp review ever and I can't emphasize enough just how much this place rocked it. Oh AND it's BYOB, which I didn't realize going in, but low and behold they have a wine/beer/liquor delivery service a few stores down... so literally wine was delivered to my table before the meal. THEN, my snow crab legs with mild garlic and butter sauce were wonderful to dig through and enjoy, I was sad when it was over. But not too sad, because the dessert that awaited me was blissfully personalized-- and as a person who LOVES popsicles, this was the dream. You choose one of their unique ice cream popsicle flavors and then add unlimited toppings, which were also unique. The fruity pebbles cereal topping option brought me back to my childhood, just enough! Wasn't overbearing or too hipster, just plain delicious. And btw, it is AFFORDABLE! I paid about 23$ for a pound of snow crab in the middle of winter... so my social worker's income wasn't unwelcome.
