[{"review": "I had to try this place after a friend told me about it and having the craving for seafood, I decided to go check it out. The seafood here was pretty fresh, \u00a0but bland, you have to really peel it and leave it in the sauce for a few minutes before eating. The sauce is a bit too oily, especially the crab pad sauce. I don't really like the concept of ordering seafood by the pound, I'm not very comfortable with that measure, because most of it was more on shell than meat. so I ended up paying for a \u00a0bunch of shells.", "review_date": "4/28/2017", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Patricia S.", "user_id": "AihNFblPKpieqU2fmKuvew"}, {"review": "Didn't even knew it existed until we were looking for places nearby since our $1 thursday flautas was a fail.my bf thinks it's better than the sauce in boiling crab; you can judge that for yourself but i would say it's pretty amazing.this was the best thing i've ever put in my mouth!(exaggeration) it was; really good.if you are ok with getting dirty (by dirty; i mean covered in butter); then this is the spot for you.it had a ton of meat and was honestly amazing.medium spicy.she always came by to check up on us and asked if we needed anythingfood: we had 4lbs of seafood (2 lbs of whole shrimp; 1 lb mussels; and 1 lb crawfish).the crab legs in just the garlic butter weren't near as good as the shrimp; so we were dipping them in the shrimp sauce.shrimp with garlic butter mild: must get.the crawfish was a little salty; but that was expected since it wasn't in season.", "review_date": "11/10/2016", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Neal G.", "user_id": "hDBhuSFUKoDYFM8y1gL66g"}, {"review": "A night from hell.

I have been looking for a quality, but high quantity, seafood place in Chicago since I moved here 4 years ago, and I finally found it! What lovely and attentive service, with both server and hostess offering options and advice to guide us through this wonderful meal. I have to say, as a former server, they cleared our messy-ass butter and garlic filled table without hesitation. This is my first yelp review ever and I can't emphasize enough just how much this place rocked it. Oh AND it's BYOB, which I didn't realize going in, but low and behold they have a wine/beer/liquor delivery service a few stores down... so literally wine was delivered to my table before the meal. THEN, my snow crab legs with mild garlic and butter sauce were wonderful to dig through and enjoy, I was sad when it was over. But not too sad, because the dessert that awaited me was blissfully personalized-- and as a person who LOVES popsicles, this was the dream. You choose one of their unique ice cream popsicle flavors and then add unlimited toppings, which were also unique. The fruity pebbles cereal topping option brought me back to my childhood, just enough! Wasn't overbearing or too hipster, just plain delicious. And btw, it is AFFORDABLE! I paid about 23$ for a pound of snow crab in the middle of winter... so my social worker's income wasn't unwelcome. The atmosphere was fun and high energy, although I would take away the TVs which to me scream \"Millennial\" (even tho I am a millennial, lol). So if you want to crack your way through some crab legs or other delish finger seafoods, GO HERE!!!", "review_date": "2/11/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Erin M.", "user_id": "gvdgrzMUOxm7aZFYGXTyFw"}, {"review": "Delicious.

We ordered king crab, a lobster tail for each of us, and the crawfish in the house sauce, mild spicy. This was some of the best seafood I've had in Chicago, and I've lived here over 40 years. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. We started with the crab and crawfish and decided on the lobster for round two. Fast, fun, messy, fun, delicious, messy and fun! Wait staff is really nice and helpful. Environment is super casual. Don't be shy of the messy fun - it's worth it! We ended our meal with THE BEST ice cream popsicles I've ever tasted. We thought they looked good and they take the base flavor and add toppings if you like. Upon first taste, my eyes virtually popped out of my head. They are creamy and the flavors are incredibly fresh and scrumptious. Don't miss these at the end of your meal!

I'll admit it, I'm a part of the \"new\" Logan Square. I wasn't here when it was a little rougher. I moved here a year ago from Wicker Park. I was SO EXCITED when I heard they were opening up an \"Angry Crab\" a couple blocks away. We absolutely love The Angry Crab and the same can be said for The Crab Pad. The service is fantastic and everything is fresh and perfect. My only advice for people not wanting to spend a ton of money is to take it easy the first time.
