"I love Mexican food and this place really hit the ball out of the park! I would definitely recommend this place for people looking for a nice little spot with creative dishes. A very hip feel to it, and very trendy, but the food is nevertheless, not a gimmick.","4/17/2017","5.0 star rating","mQviFWhgTFCtsprW2rh7-w","Mike M."
"I had the pleasure of dining here with 5 others, and everything was fantastic! The food was delicious and affordable, and the mixed drinks were superb. We shared many different options from all parts of the menu and thoroughly enjoyed everything that came out of the kitchen. I particularly enjoyed the steak burrito and the guacamole. I'm thrilled that Logan Square has such a wonderfully authentic Mexican restaurant and will be returning often.","3/30/2017","5.0 star rating","B76lguQfnEbGd3kjz5M4gw","Jeffrey S."
