"Wonderful experience! My friends live close by and have been talking about this for weeks. We went in on a Friday night and sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen ( place is small). It was quickly apparent that they have a ton of talent for such a small place.  We started with the mezcal margaritas which if you haven't had please do. The smokiness of the drink works perfectly with the sweet and tart... unfortunately it may have ruined all other margaritas for me.For dinner we ordered basically one of everything as we were so hungry! We had the enchiladas  (amazing! Not what you expect but truly a treat), all four tacos (be careful carna asada is warm but really really good), the steak burrito  ( a strong dinner on it's own), and to finish we had the sea bass with a green mole...... OMG I could drink the mole and fish  was perfect!!Don't want to fanboy out to much but this is  the best meal I have had in a minute! Great food, great ambiance, and great company equals the perfect meal. Great job!","4/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rpFKdFyk97eY8uDXNusYGg","Brendan M."
"Two tacos, enjoyed twice within two weeks because it's that damn good! Mi Tocaya Antojeria, the kind of place that will see me often because upon entry, the smells, to the first touch of customer service; a trust was built straight away, then a comfort and from there you want to engage and try everything - sample all the true warm flavors this place has to offer. The chips are made super fresh - hell everything is. If you can sit at the bar and check out the artistry, do that. Draft cocktails are big here and I really enjoyed the blackberry mojito. On my first visit, I met a cool guy named Froggy - he prepared my food and really showed his skill and love. It's not just him, you can taste the love and passion for the food here. Mi Tocaya Antojeria is owned and operated by a really talented woman so I'm all in to support that, more so when life changing deliciousness is being churned out.I have a hankering for tacos often and the tacos I've enjoyed here: the Chucho's Pollo (smoked beer can chicken+ avocado) and the Milpa (butternut squash, chile, beans + avocado).  The beer can chicken, so full of flavor, tender and juicy - shredded thin and totally remarkable. The Milpa, lots of fresh vegetables, great textures, bright citrus and totally craveable. I have also had the Fish con Mole Verde and what a phenomenal meal! The fish, beautifully prepared with big bold flavors and the mole had just a hint of heat in the back. You can tell that mole took hours - there's a sensation, you feel something - it is good energy.On the sweeter side of things, I've had both desserts (Flan De Queso and Tres Leches Cake w/ Chocolate) and both are beautiful, simple and clean - highly recommend you save room for this course.  It is official, the stage has been set for this to be a go to spot! You will fondly remember the culinary experience here as well as good times you're sure to have.","4/27/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HR5TCqAjP9rlM_n_BA0JfA","Kay X."
"Located right on the Boulevard and not in a heavy restaurant area, it's clear that Mi Tocaya is going to have to work to draw people in. And I'm not sure they're ready to work.I came on a Wednesday afternoon when I was out walking with my friend and her dog. Their patio was open and seemed dog friendly (there was another dog at a table) so we decided to stop for dinner and drinks.I love the concept of an ""authentic"" taqueria but I'm not entirely sure it translates well. Their menu is full of interesting options but lacks descriptions. So you have to ask about every single thing (unless you know your Spanish dishes). And the waitress we had only described a few options (probably the more popular items on the menu). And while I'm not a bilingual, I know enough Spanish to know I couldn't handle her butchering another word. I ordered the Guisado de Nopales which came with a side of cheese curds (""cheese curds from Wisconsin""). And while I love cheese curds I'm not entirely sure it fit well with the dish. The guisado had cactus (nopales) and squash and it came with some tortillas on the side. It was flavorful and delicious. But it was described to me as a soup and it was not a soup. It was still good though. The drinks were delicious - I had the pisco cocktail and my friend order the mezcal cocktail with the elder flowers. Gosh, that was a very flowery cocktail but it was good. The pisco cocktail was okay but I wouldn't order it again. While the mezcal cocktail had a ton of flavor, the pisco tasted like a watered down sangria. At this point, I would've given the restaurant a 4 stars for trying. But once we had our food, the waitress basically ignored us. We probably waited about 15 minutes before we were able to get her attention for the check. This combined with her spotty attention towards us throughout the experience put a damper on the whole experience.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my meal and I want to say I'll give them a second chance. I hope most of my issues with the place are due to the growing pains of a new restaurant ironing out their kinks combined with a busy spring patio season. I think I recommend this restaurant. Although, I will say, if you are pressed for time, I wouldn't come here.","4/27/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cVce0x5fvbP7oBEtkfO9sw","Anamaria H."
"I was there with a friend last week Friday to see what the hype was all about! We didn't have a reservation but we made our mind to wait and get a table or just eat at the bar. We waited about an hour for a table but at least we were able to get drinks at the bar. We asked the waiter what their most popular dish was and he recommended the ""Longaniza con queso y rajas"" which is just a type of Mexican sausage with cheese and poblano pepper. We ordered that as an app to share and I ordered the steak burrito and my friend the enchiladas. The steak burrito was nothing spectacular for the price, it was just steak, cheese, caramelized onions, and lettuce and it was paired with a sauce that was like a guacamole. I felt like the steak burrito I can get a better one at wide array or restaurants in the area and a lot cheaper. My friend liked the enchiladas but said there was nothing outstanding about them. The mezcal old fashioned was really good and was probably the spotlight of the night! They do have a good selection of cocktails and also saw a table ordered a 32oz Pacifico beer so that was pretty cool. I also did not like that their ventilation is not great and the kitchen is literally right there so you walk out smelling like food which is not cool if you are still planning on going out after dinner. Maybe sitting outside once the patio opens will be a better idea?? Not sure if I will be back anytime soon since I like to try new restaurants instead. I would recommend making a reservation in advance if you really want to try this place.","4/19/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ggxWkchRaPuRrgCT_ERTXQ","Jesus G."
"This is not your standard Mexican taqueria in Chitown. Watch out for this chef folks!  The food is on point and banging with mad flavors. I can't wait to brag that I beat everyone to the punch to this restaurant. The menu is very unique. Every dish has its traditional Mexican flavor with a twist from the talented chef. After eating dinner and being completely stuffed, Mi novia and I already planned what new dishes we are going to order next time, after stuffing our faces with the flan de queso dessert. The lenqua + peanut butter was uber delish!  Lamb albondigas was equally as good and plated perfectly.  Both are must orders!  The salsa and chips had great flavor and perfect amount of heat. The nopalitos with fried cheese curds are a fantastic veggie option with good heat.Im like a kid in the candy store that can't wait to come back and try the other menu items","3/14/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=H7H0ht0bNzt1MWbyY8HXfg","Philip T."
"The food and atmosphere is amazing. Above all, the energy and knowledge of the staff makes the experience that much greater. It's worth the wait, but I highly recommend reservations because this place is always booked that way you're not restricted in time (though it's worth the time restrictions as well). The managers are very attentive and make sure everyone has a great experience. Their blackberry mojito and burrito are so good!","4/23/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZbCe3F4L75jzzDJEpbZfyw","Crystal C."
"So disappointing.  Traveled a long way to have someone poorly handle us. We heard great things about this new restaurant and didn't have a reservation. We went there early (at 5 pm) risking that they may not be able to accommodate us.  We were willing to take that risk because we are foodies and love great new experiences.  When we got there, it was empty and just opening.  They said they COULD accommodate us and made us WAIT outside while they set up.   After waiting a while, someone different came out and said we can have a table but ""You need to leave in an hour- I need the table"".   Pace is largely dictated by the kitchen and service- and while we may not have taken an hour (we had other plans) We elected to leave.  There is probably a better way to handle this and am disappointed they made us feel uncomfortable. I would have preferred them to say they could not accommodate us. Perhaps a more skilled host could have handled it differently.","4/22/2017","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CzoMFfF4pUU3a6JFmZqKhA","Marie D."
"This new adorable restaurant is a hop, skip, and a jump from our house and I have a feeling we will be skipping there for a delicious dinner or cocktail way too often. Visited on Saturday night a mere three days after they opened and if I didn't know they had only been in business a few days I never would have believed it. The food was amazing, the drinks just perfect (both in taste and price), and the pacing was just right. We started with chips and (the best) guac, and then followed with mussels (that broth!), queso fundido (that sausage!), and tacos (get the three meat one...you won't regret it!). Two cocktails a piece (the banana one might be my new favorite cocktail ever) and we were set. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, especially the burrito. Thank you for stopping by our table to make sure everything was going smoothly, Chef Diana! What a welcome addition Mi Tocaya is to Logan Blvd and LS in general. We will be back, probably sometime this week! (My only suggestion is the addition of a regular margarita...sometime you just want a good ol' lime marg on the rocks!)","3/20/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vx7VvQq8KUV_Qo7uuV6NWQ","Jill O."

"The food here is very good. Its creative and very tasty. The only reason that I didn't give higher marks is that the service was not very good. The servers were very friendly however, we waited  over an hour for our chips and salsa we did not have any silverware until our third dish came out. I am going to chalk it up to that they are very new and still working out some kinks. I am excited to go back and experience the restaurant when they have worked out their bugs. I am not alone in this experience the table next to us had chips on their table for attest 30 min before guacamole came out and the table on my other side had no silverware for the majority of their evening as well.","3/25/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zm9NDjISyeO5XuVNGfltqQ","Matthew S."
"Mi Tocaya Antojeria is fantastic! It can be rare for my husband and I to go to a restaurant, try several things, and REALLY enjoy everything that we ordered. We loved EVERYTHING! We made reservations online and they were right on time with seating us even though the restaurant was packed. They have a variety of draft cocktails, bottles and cans and they're all fairly priced. I had the Blackberry Mojito which was sparkling, nicely sweet, and wasn't too minty. My husband had the Cabana which tasted like a banana runt and was unique and awesome. Our server rocked, I wish I remembered his name! He took a lot of time explaining the menu and the chef's vision and it was much appreciated! We ordered chips and salsa, the peanut butter y lengua, the cactus stew with fried cheese curds, the longaniza queso funded, and the tres leche cake. The salsa is crave-worthy. The lengua was tender and well balanced with grilled radish and pickled onions and a deliciously creamy peanut butter sauce. The cactus stew was also so good, we were practically licking the bowl. The tres leche cake was dense but not too sweet, and the perfect portion for a sweet end to the meal. So excited to have this restaurant just blocks away. They made it extremely easy to love them!

"Really lovely experience! Walked into a packed house, but didn't have to wait very long for a table. We were greeted by a very pleasant and prompt host, and taken to a table as soon as it was available. The host also mentioned right away a few of the items they were out of, which I thought was a nice touch, considering these guys are brand new and still working on what to order, etc.We sat and were greeted by a somewhat shy but very knowledgeable server named Andreas. Extremely friendly, he recommended a few dishes and took our drink order. I had the Sangrisco (a tart play on pisco and sangria) and my beau had a Tecate. I definitely enjoyed my cocktail, though a bit on the acidic side for my taste- I certainly want to try some others!We started with the ceviche, and got the avocado on the side (which is whipped and frankly, amazing). The ceviche was slightly pricey, but worth it. Big chunks of fish with zesty lime and the sweetness of the avocado was very appetizing.Our food was taking a bit longer to arrive (though honestly, we didn't notice), and our server graciously brought out complimentary mussels. Again, a fantastic dish- crispy radish and flavorful broth were wonderful accents to the mussels.For mains, I chose the asada and chicken tacos, and my boyfriend got the steak burrito. And hot damn. The asada taco was a little overpowered by the chorizo, but the chicken taco is one of the best I've had. Soft, juicy chicken, with tangy red onion and crunchy cabbage was a terrific combo. The steak burrito was also great, and a good deal for the price. I'm a big fan of flan, so I had to try the flan de queso. Holy. God. It's the consistency of flan one dreams of, thick and creamy, with tangy vanilla sauce and sprinkles of cheese. I'd go back just for the flan, honestly. Overall, I'm so pleased with this experience. The staff is very sweet and clearly cares about the service you're getting and the food you receive. It's a tiny place, so you'll have to wait, but it's totally worth it. I'm excited to return, especially when they get into their groove and of course, when it's warm enough for that adorable patio. I wish these guys all the luck.","3/28/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=T-QomrL-dWBsjAvJjZ74-w","Chelsea M."
"I cannot recommend this new gem in Logan Square highly enough. The place is adorable and funky-fun. The FOOD! It is all about fantastic food. It is clear that Chef Diana has put her heart and soul in this menu. Where to begin...With a fabulous cocktail on tap... a margarita or mojito... that is right on tap and delicious. Don't skip the guacamole... never skip the guacamole. Then order whatever sounds good ... you cannot go wrong. All the tacos are fabulous. I have never had a steak burrito as tasty as the one at Mi Tocaya. We went with a big group so we ordered and passed the plates around... ceviche, peanut butter y lengua, guisado de nopalitos (cactus and cheese curds), and lamb albondiga (meatballs) were all fantastic.Leave room for dessert... Flan or Tres Leches... YUM! Add a little nitro coffee and horchata (both on tap) and you will leave stuffed and satisfied wanting to return to try more of Chef Diana's menu.","3/30/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fwV4An1BH2JwgxB3d4cG9A","melissa c."

"This place was alright - def NOT as awsome as the other reviews make it seem. Menu is very, very limited.  Tried all the different types of tacos and they had somewhat of a creative spin on them I suppose and tasted not bad for the most part.  The shrimp cevice appetizer was nothing special - in fact, I've had it much better elsewhere.  Also tried the drinks here and they were just horrendous - literally tasted like cough syrup.  Ambiance is pretty lively and makes it stand apart from some of the other oh so many Mexican restaurants in the area.  But overall, the experience just wasn't memorable enough to warrant coming back a second time.  Tacos that are just not bad doesn't exactly do it for me.","4/24/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vjuhmYB0ETOUsqp2LAb3sQ","John H."

"This place has so much potential but they have to fix the front of the house. We made reservations yesterday and the host told us our table was almost ready. He went on to sit two parties that walked in well after us. I don't think he would have sat us even after that had I not approached him. I checked my phone to find out he had actually cancelled our online reservation rather than accept it. I would have let it go had he acknowledged the mistake. Instead he blew me off and said its busy and he was trying. With this type of attitude, the food will not make up for it. I saw catalpa fail in this location partly due to service issues. I would hate to see this one fail as well because of the same problem.","4/23/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ya4ERBh_uLuMY8lp7SyyYQ","M B."

"Came here last Friday night. Place is ""cozy"" probably seats 20-30 people inside but they have a patio for the summer. Only complaint about the atmosphere is it was fairly loud with the music on. Our waiter was super informative and did an excellent job explaining the dishes. However he was busy and had forgotten he already went through the menu with us when we were about to order. We tried the Chips and Salsa and Carne Cruda for apps. Chips were super tasty - homemade! Carne Cruda had good flavor but not sure I would order it again for the small amount of meat in the dish and portion size. My husband and I both ordered margaritas. He had the blanco and I have the mezcal. Both were tasty. Now for the main event.. TACOS- I have to say these were some of the best tacos I have had. I had the Al Pastor and Campencho. Campencho was AMAZING! Al Pastor was also delicious but on the spicy side. My mother had the Chucho's Pollo and was raving about it all weekend!
