I went about a week ago and the whole place was literally in chaos. At one point the smoke alarm in the kitchen was going off for about 10 minutes. They ended up having to leave the back door open in order to prevent that from happening again I guess so I ended up eating my meal in the cold.It also took over an hour for the food to come to us. Our waitress forgot to put in our order. She gave us the wrong order at first, and then when we told her that it wasn't what we ordered she tried to insist that she was. Finally she realized that she made a mistake but of course apologizing was going to be too difficult for her.We finally ended up getting our food and of course by then our rice was cold. The chicken was dry. The flavors were good but it didn't make up for the dry chicken or the abysmal service and atmosphere.The prices are also incredibly high. You pay about $15-16 for some type of chicken dish and that doesn't even include rice...Was originally super excited about this place but most likely will not be coming back.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kMBxckUyXm7zoYFqH6EsRA", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name": "Anne W."}, {"review_date": "4/9/2017", "review": "My friend and I ordered 2 dishes to go. \u00a0Our food was ready within 15 minutes. \u00a0(While waiting, I recommend popping cross the street to FoodSmart for cocktail ingredients or desert to accompany your meal.) \u00a0The prices are typical for the area ($10-15 for an entree) and the man taking our order was attentive and outgoing.When we arrived home, they had mixed up the order. \u00a0Upon calling, they graciously offered for us to come in and pick up the right entree whenever we were in the area. \u00a0Mix-ups happen and they handled it very well.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BGeKBx3067vJ0kZgtGoB1Q", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "C P."}, {"review_date": "3/30/2017", "review": "Logan Square was lacking in Indian restaurants but finally that has been solved!
