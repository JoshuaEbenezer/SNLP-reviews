There is plenty of seating, though I think the front area is best as it has so much natural light. If available, ask for a table there. It was a busy Sunday morning and we had reservations so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly and attentive and though they were obviously busy and turning tables around quickly, we never felt rushed. There was also a manager coming around from time to time who was quite nice. We started with a hot chai for my husband and the warm cider cocktail for me. We also split a sticky bun, which was mouthwateringly good. We then decided to split a sweet and savory entr\u00e9e. I ordered the skillet with braised pork, chickpeas, brussels sprouts, and lentils. It was VERY good and a large portion. Enough to take home if you are eating it on your own. My husband ordered the brioche French toast. Brioche anything is obviously amazing, but this French toast was particularly great. We really liked the whipped pumpkin ricotta it came with.

I'm so happy we found this place because we absolutely loved it! We are planning on coming here for brunch soon since all the pictures look so delicious. The dinner was wonderful! I want to come back to try all the appetizers. They have a great outdoor area for when the weather is nice and the whole vibe is very intimate. They also have an option to sit infront of the kitchen which seems like a cool idea. They also take reservations which you should do before coming here because it was very crowded when we arrived. We ordered the crispy brussels sprouts, steak tartare, the uovo ravioli as appetizers. Every appetizer was better then the next. The brussel sprouts are a must! The brussel sprouts come with toasted pistachio, parmagiano, miso vinaigrette, and bonito flake. They were literally the best brussel sprouts I ever had. The steak tartare came on a HUGE wooden board. It can be easily split between two people. The steak tartare came with wagyu, egg emulsion, cucumber, caper, and homemade brioche. The brioche paired perfectly with the tartare. When I ordered the raviolo I knew it only came with one. I wasn't expecting a huge dish as it being just an appetizer but it was this big blob of ravioli that came with ricotta, sweet jalape\u00f1o, house-cured pancetta, and \u00a0white truffle butter. It was a really rich dish and I enjoyed it. As for entrees I ordered the grilled sirloin and my boyfriend ordered the trout. My boyfriend and I weren't the biggest fans of our entrees and thought the appetizers and shared plates were so great that we thought the entrees would blow it out of the park. The sirloin came with hen of the wood mushroom, grilled sweet potato, cipollini onion, streusel, b\u00e9arnaise, parmigiano, sweet potato pur\u00e9e,and rosemary. I thought the seasoning was a little over powering and had a dash of too much rosemary. The trout came with butternut squash gnocchi, charred cauliflower, roasted fennel, crispy butternut squash, horseradish and cauliflower pur\u00e9e, and sumac. He wasn't really blown away with his dish either. For drinks we ordered their cocktails. We weren't really impressed with any of the cocktails we ordered. I ordered the basil smash and the paloma.

This place is as good as (and even better, in some cases) \u00a0any restaurant in West Loop, for a significantly lower price and without the pretension. \u00a0The food is incredible, the service outstanding, and the ambiance is relaxed with close quarters. Food: We had the Brussel Sprouts, Cauliflower, Okonomiyaki, and Raviolo. Every bite was packed with flavor. The flavor profiles in the Brussel Sprouts, Cauliflower, and Okonomiyaki were similar, which made the meal feel cohesive. The four dishes were the perfect amount for two people and were around $10 each - super-reasonable for something so damn delicious. Drinks: Gather is a wine bar, and they definitely deliver on the wine-front. I had a grenache blanc, which was an incredible, citrus-y wine, without being too sweet or too dry. My partner had a cabernet sauvignon, which was slightly roasty and very smooth. Rachel - our waiter - was gracious enough to send me a tasting of the grenache. Service: Gather's staff does a fantastic job making you feel at home and welcome. Shout-out to our servers, Rachel and Rachel! They brought small tastings of wine to try to get the perfect glass, and they made a great recommendation with the Raviolo. They were super down-to-earth and seemed to genuinely enjoy stopping by our table. The host was also gracious, offering to take my coat and recommending a spot to grab a drink before dinner. The rest of the wait staff also did a fantastic job: our water glasses were never empty, and they always explained each part of the dishes when they were brought out. Atmosphere: It's a little dark and a little close-in-quarters. However, this didn't bother my partner and I at all - we were still able to hold great conversations, and we weren't elbow-to-elbow with our fellow diners. It is a little upscale, but definitely approachable. The only time when the space was a little bit of an issue was going down a narrow path to the bathroom, but the staff gave me the right-of-way, which was unexpectedly charming.

Grabbing a couple of seats at the coveted kitchen counter (of which Chicago sadly doesn't have many), I correctly assumed that I would enjoy everything that I'd try ... it just seemed like all the cooks gave a shit. And with a kitchen so minuscule, there'd be much less room for error. Happily, the BF and I were impressed from start to finish. The words \"balance\" and \"precision\" popped into my mind continually during dinner. Our cocktails, a simple Weller 7-year old fashioned and a Sequenza (an intriguing and refreshing mix of Cardamaro, Luxardo maraschino, and mint--I would tank a pitcher), were flawless. Gather's tartare, a glistening mince of beef, was judiciously flavored and given textural contrast by chopped capers, cucumber brunoise, and pops of chive. The impeccably toasted house-made brioche made me sad for all future toast I'd have.I couldn't get enough of the cardoon soup, a warming, wintry potage dotted with tiny caramelized shallots and fresh chervil. Candied jalape\u00f1o and toothsome house-cured pancetta kept the egg yolk raviolo, with its heady white truffle butter and ricotta filling, from feeling overly heavy. An ingenious braised oxtail rosti nearly overshadowed my perfectly roasted sturgeon, which got a sweetly earthy boost from red beet vinaigrette and creamy kohlrabi puree. Likewise, impeccable butternut squash gnocchi almost stole the show from the shatteringly crisp rainbow trout, whose pleasant kick came from touches of horseradish and sumac.

We were seated at the high top tables in the very back and it was awesome because they can only accommodate 3 parties, so we were able to get a little loud without offending the families in the front part of the restaurant.

Anyways...Emily was our waitress and she was very attentive, patient, and articulated the menu selections to our satisfaction. Since we were a group of 4, we started with the Gather Board, brussel sprouts, and fried mushrooms. All amazing selections! The chicken liver mousse that accompanies the board was some of the best that I have ever had! The cheese selection was on point and the homemade cranberry sauce was a huge hit!For our main courses, we shared the fried chicken, spaghetti, scallops, and rainbow trout. All were extremely good! The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection. The chicken was some of the best that I have ever had. It tasted like it had a hint of honey in it and it was not greasy. Oh, and the biscuit was delish and light! You could tell the spaghetti was homemade; definitely a welcome change from basic spaghetti. The trout was just perfect and the butternut sage gnocchi was a great addition.For dessert, they only had 3 options and we got them all; the chocolate peanut butter brownie, apple fritters, and pot de creme.

The started with a salad that was good if not particularly memorable. I quite liked the grilled chicken flatbread, but my dining companion found it too dry.

I hate grape fruit like i do with a passion people hate cilantro well grape fruit is my cilantro. Its sweet acidic flavor made the salad taste so much better. The argula tasted really good alot of times it has a really funky bitter taste thats really awful but its really high quality. The vinaigrette was really tasty it wasnt to acidic sometimes they could be way to acidic. The best part of the dish are these garlic fritters! Omg omg fuck croutons garlic fritters are in they taste so good and rich and are so crunchy ask for more cause they only give u two pieces u will thank me$10 Butternut squash gnocchi: amaizin!

The brownie was perfect no dark chocolate really this was so decedent. Their was this orange flavor that went perfectly with the chocolate n cut through the sweatness a must order $9 Apple fritters: omg the fritters are so big! Their like as big as oranges.

This experience had been accompanied by hopeful and nervous expectations that would be surpassed.We walked into the restaurant and were quickly greeted by a friendly smiling individual, unfortunately we were not quite prepared to take our seats just yet. The hostess/servers were very accommodating and patient and promptly seated us once we were ready; I should mention that we had a reservation and that they reserve 50% of their seating for walk-ins every night. The restaurant was narrow with an intimate atmosphere. The lights were dimmed to a pleasing level and they had nonabrasive music playing just loud enough to realize there was music but not so loud that you couldn't partake in conversation.Once seated, a gentleman came around the table and filled our water glasses, a practice he continued regularly throughout the meal. Our waitress came to our table and took our drink orders. The drink menu is expansive and versatile. I had \"the Count\" and my dinner companions had a glass of red wine, an \"Overnight Sensation\", a \"Whiskey Smash\", and a \"Basil Smash\" which I would order for myself later. Each cocktail was well crafted and presented in an appealing glass appropriate for the cocktail.After ordering our cocktails, we ordered hors d'oeuvres. We chose to try the \"crispy brussel sprouts\", which were topped with toasted pistachio, parmagiano, miso vinaigrette, and bonito flakes (flakes of dried smoked tuna), and the \"whipped ricotta\", which was topped with honey and a balsamic vinegar that was slightly viscous, well balanced, and of excellent quality, and served with lightly toasted slices of house made baguette. Both dishes were fantastic and well presented. The brussel sprout were crisp and nicely caramelized around the edges and then accented by the slight saltiness from the miso vinaigrette and smokiness from the bonito flakes. Each bold flavor brought an interesting and delightful taste that both amplified the vegetable taste and transformed it into something wonderful. The whipped ricotta, once spread on the baguette, had a very umami profile to it. the sweetness of the cheese and honey was balanced out by touch of savory bitterness form the balsamic vinegar and the salty note from the baguettes. The texture of the cheese and bread was noteworthy, bring together a creamy smooth richness with the soft yet chewy toasty baguette.After our hors d'oeuvres, the waitress took order for the entr\u00e9e portion of the meal. I ordered the \"roasted sturgeon\", which was accompanied by braised oxtail rosti, apple jam, kohlrabi spoon bread, beet vinaigrette, kohlrabi pur\u00e9e, radish + kohlrabi salad. I must begin by stating that I am not who enjoys fish very much, having said this, this dish was fantastic. I began by asking if the fish was farm raised or wild caught with the reason for my inquiry being that it significantly affects how \"fishy\" it tastes. The waitress informed me that all the fish they serve is wild caught and can even source the body of water it from which it came. The sturgeon was nicely browned adding to the texture that I can only describe as \"lobster like\" with a slight flak to it. The way it was prepared and quality nearly removed any, if not all, fishy taste I had expected to experience. The cut was a reasonable portion and very enjoyable. It was served atop a kohlrabi spoon bread, which was slightly dense yet fluffy with a slight sweet taste that was somewhat reminiscent of a moister cornbread. The braised oxtail rosti was also very delicious and savory. The potatoes were nice and crispy which contrasted well with the shredded oxtail. Finally, the plate was garnished with a kohlrabi puree with the radish-kohlrabi salad atop it with a beet vinaigrette adding a little more color and earthy flavor to the dish. Over all the dish far exceeded my expectations and I would strongly recommend this dish even if you're not a fan of fish.My overall experience at Gather was very pleasing. The food was fantastic, clean, and creative. The bill came to $55 a person, but considering we had 6 drinks, 2 hors d'oeuvres, 3 entrees, and 2 salads between the 4 of us with magnificent service it is a reasonable price for the experience and quality.

Usually I don't make my way out here because it's definitely farther out as far as neighborhoods go, but after a quick morning missing the half-acre taproom tour, came by because this was in the area anyhow. To note; upon entering you definitely appreciate the open-air kitchen, and even before ordering you could see that most of the dishes seemed to be hearty with excellent presentation. Our full party wasn't there, so they seated us at the bar where we were served very promptly and they gave us a lot of good recommendations for food, despite not ordering any food. Once we were all there, we all mainly got different dishes, allowing us to try things from the chicken & waffles, benedict, Johnny cakes, French omelet, and skillet. The menu isn't as large as a dedicated brunch spot, but for around the same price($10-13 each), every entr\u00e9e was nicely presented, and had excellent flavor and texture for the dish. There was nothing there that we didn't like. Add on top of that attentive service and some fairly unique dishes(the Johnny cakes were cornmeal pancakes with a tomato broth served with creamy eggs and crispy pork belly, for example), and this could easily be a 1st line brunch place if it was a little closer.

Definitely an appetizer that comes recommended.- Roasted Sturgeon: The sturgeon is the texture of swordfish but more tender, more flavorful. - Half Chicken: They prepare chicken two ways - pan searing the chicken breast and deep frying chicken thigh over a bed of polenta. It was DELICIOUS. The chicken breast was the most tender, moist, and flavorful chicken breast I've ever eaten. The fried chicken thigh was perfectly crisp, super flavorful, and the bed of polenta helped give the entree a layer of richness. It could've used more polenta but it was a surprisingly filling plate.- Grilled Sirloin: There was a LOT going on on this plate. The sirloin was super flavorful, tender, and the texture was melt in your mouth delicious. They also had these fried mushrooms that were AMAZING, just as beefy, just as crispy, perfect accompaniment to the steak.Warning: Be careful if you sit out on the patio, it can get pretty cold pretty quick.

Hubby and me were here on a week night for dinner. I am glad we had reservations because the place was full. It is a small, intimate restaurant with friendly service. Both of us were famished so we ordered a bunch of food - and it was definitely way too much for us. We ordered the crispy brussels sprouts and the whipped ricotta with honey and balsamic which is served with toasted baguette. Ummm... they were both delicious dishes but the whipped ricotta dish is just out of this world decadent. Did it feel like dessert - yes, was it tasty af - hell yes!! The portions were big for the gather and share dishes and we would have been better off ordering just one of them. Next we ordered the butternut squash soup - it was delicious. Earthy and complex, yet delicious and comforting. This was my favorite of all the dishes. We also ordered the spaghetti dish - this one was my least favorite. It was a bit too heavy with the butter and pine nuts - it needed something to lighten it up and something to punch up the flavor. But overall it was a solid meal and we had a lot of food leftover to take home. The reason I take away half a star is because of the time it takes to get the dishes. I understand it is a small kitchen with 3 people working, but the pacing of the dishes is uneven and the whole dinner took us almost 2 hours to finish.

Make sure you make a reservation and they will give you the option of sitting at the chef's bar where you can watch food be prepared, was a little warm at first but really worth it. Chef Ken Carter was super nice and had great recommendations for our first experience here. All of the dishes were great for sharing! Drinks: The drinks were ok, took a while for mine but then I noticed there was an entire back room full of other guests. I'd probably stick with something off their wine menu next time. Food: We started with Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Steak Tartare. We got to watch the whole process of cooking each, which was sooooo cool! The brussel sprouts were the best either of us had ever had. The pistachios really make it amazing, we add them to ours at home now. We ended up getting a second side of brussel sprouts after finishing the first because for only $8 I wanted 12 more sides of it! The Steak Tartare was really good as well, the little mushroom shaped pieces of toast paired with the salad was just as visually stunning as it was tasty. For our main dish we shared the Sirloin with fried tomatillos! I was skeptical about this dish but Chef Ken didn't let us down! Wasn't heavy but just right. Dessert: APPLE FRITTERRRRR... Ok this apple fritter was the bombist way to end this great meal. I will probably get my own next time. We had no idea about the Sunday dinner menu until we got there and will definitely go back to try it because it is new each week, so I've heard.

I have been here twice for brunch and more times for dinner than I can count and my biggest advice, besides coming here and never eating anywhere else ever again, is to sit at the kitchen counter! Seriously, I think it is literally the best seat in the house. Sure, the high stools are a little difficult to sit on considering my short legs, but it's worth the climb. First of all, the restaurant gets loud and my fiance and I realized that sitting next to each other at the kitchen counter was actually much better for conversation purposes rather than sitting across from each other, unless you prefer to enjoy your food in silence, which I totally get. Another benefit of the kitchen counter is that you get to watch Ken, the chef supreme of Gather live and in action! It's a thrill, I promise.

We came here for a Girls' Night Out and discovered that the passed plate \"Gather and Share\" options are phenomenal and the cocktails are well crafted.We started the night off with drinks. My first choice was the Overnight Sensation. It was really great, but I preferred my friend's Dark + Stormy. The winner of the night was their Whiskey Smash. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I really don't like whiskey, so if you can get me to enjoy it or something made with it, you're doing a great job! I absolutely adored that the few ingredients inside it played so well together. I gotta hand it to the server for this surprise suggestion.We couldn't decide what we wanted for our first course; thus, we ordered the Whipped Ricotta, Steak Tartare, Crispy Brussel (sic) Sprouts, Cured Salmon, Roasted Cauliflower and the Charred Green Beans. So, basically the entire starters menu. I regret nothing. Actually, I regret not having more Whipped Ricotta, because that was out of this world.The group's second favorite was the Cured Salmon. Our least favorite might have been the Steak Tartare. It was good, but not a standout. It's one of those things that's cool to try to say you did it but you don't necessarily need to repeat the experience. With that being said, I would gladly eat it again if someone else ordered it and was sharing. I just think there are much more memorable options on the menu.When it came to the main course, that was not at all a hard decision: \"Burger - white cheddar, house smoked bacon, caramelized onion, red pepper a\u00efoli, brioche, fries.\" It was a no-brainer. In fact, it sounded so tantalizing that the majority of us ordered that. Unfortunately, all of us who got it also thought it was completely lackluster. The burger was cooked a little past what we wanted, though the meat itself and the toppings had a good taste; however, the bun was incredibly dense and dry. I took the bun off and only ate half the burger. I would not order this again. They charge you $14, but this is not a burger worthy of that price tag. The perfectly cooked side of fries were the highlight of the dish.If I had a do-over, I would probably go for the Pan Seared Cod or Diver Scallops as my entr\u00e9e instead.We went with 3 desserts at the end of the meal. We had a chocolate peanut butter dessert (decadent), chamomile panna cotta (light and delicate), and a beignet style apple fritter (fried goodness). I'd say go with the panna cotta if you wanna keep it light, but you get more mouth bang for the buck with the chocolate peanut butter or the fritter.In conclusion, come for the cocktails and the smaller courses. Do pass the burger. Do not collect $200.

I'm not sure I've had such a good meal in Chicago in years. Gather blew me away and I highly, highly recommend visiting.My wife and I had a willy-nilly Friday night a few weeks back and after a semi-botched downtown happy hour, we decided to try and give Gather a shot. It was 7 p.m. - we didn't have a reservation and we knew we'd likely have to wait. I walked in and a lovely lady took my information down and said it'd be about an hour. Sweet.We walked over to Daily and had a beer whilst waiting - which ended up only being about 30 minutes.A quick call informed us our spots were ready, so we ventured back across the street and were pleasantly surprised to be seated at the 'chef's bar.' Unlike a 'chef's table,' the 'chef's bar' is more like a small breakfast bar that seats 6 and you watch the magic in the kitchen right before your very eyes. It was so entertaining and the chefs/cooks were so sweet - on occasion explaining what they were doing and answering any questions we threw their way.But, beyond this fun spot and great people working at this establishment, the food. Oh my God, the food.We ordered a number of sharing plates: whipped ricotta, crispy cauliflower, crispy brussels sprouts, garlic soup and the butternut squash gnocchi. I don't know what was better - there is no 'ranking' here; it was all memorable. Flavors tucked into tiny crevasses, butter and lemon through the brussels leaves, pillows of gnocchi with a delightful sauce, an amazing soup with crunchy garlic. I could never pick a favorite dish - they were all favorites.A++ service, food, reception and watching the whole scene unfold in front of us.

It was a very nice atmosphere and the wait staff could not have been more attentive. At one point, a bug flew into a Negroni and the wait staff promptly got a new cocktail on table despite the bug not even being the table's fault. Wonderful. 2 of my sisters are vegetarian and 1 is a full on carnivore, so it worked out nicely in that we got to try brussel sprouts, salmon, burger, gnocchi, mussels and more. The sprouts were very good, but the mayo was a little heavy handed. The crispy bits on top were fantastic. The salmon was one of the best dishes any of us had ever had before. I don't even know how to describe the flavor - it was amazing. The runny egg on top was the best part. The only qualm here was that there wasn't enough bread for the amount of food on the board. The gnocchi was very good, but it was the smallest of the \"share\" plates, and 1 sister ended up eating most of it based on her love of mustard (they were pretty heavy handed with the mustard seeds considering the amount of gnocchi). The mussels were flavorful, but as mussels tend to be, they were not very filling. If you enjoy seafood, then this is a good choice for a small starter to get your pallet ready for more intense flavors. We asked for more bread because there was so much liquid in the bottom of the dish that we couldn't bear letting it go wasted. Lastly, 2 of us shared the burger, and in all honesty, it was the weakest part of the meal. The burger was built well, which is important, but, the meat's juices had completely rendered the bottom bun useless and a fork and knife had to be brought in to keep things civilized. I am glad we planned the meal the way we did, since we each got to try more food, and no food went to waste, where if we all ordered entree's we definitely would have had extra, especially if someone didn't enjoy their food that much- case in point, if we had 4 burger experiences, we would all have left pretty disappointed. I would absolutely return, and I would likely plan the meal similarly: 3-4 people, 3-4 share plates, and maybe an entree that looks especially alluring.

Having had dinner there yesterday during Lincoln Square's Restaurant Week, the answer is, there is no reason. Go somewhere else.I told a friend we were going to Gather. She said she'd been there once, would be interested in my opinion and expressed hers: The place is \"precious,\" prices are high for what you get and overall the food isn't memorable. I couldn't have put it better.The special was four courses for $44, which sounded fair. We agreed to indulge and added one cocktail and a $52 bottle of wine. Only two choices in each category (appetizer, etc.) were offered and no choice for dessert. It was pecan pie.Things went fine, nothing extraordinary, nothing horrible, and then dessert arrived. One 3-inch square of pecan pie with a tiny scoop of ice cream. I sat waiting for the other two pieces. The server said we were to share this morsel. So, it wasn't four courses for $44; it was 3 1/3 courses for $44. The final sour note? A $5 cup of coffee, \u00a0which I learned today was \"bottomless,\" came in its own french press. It was served with milk, not the cream asked for.I expressed my displeasure to our server about the dessert and hoped she wouldn't call me 'darling' for the 20th time when she responded. A manager came by, said he understood we weren't thrilled with dinner, offered me his card and asked us to come back and give them another chance to please. What?

The Gathering Board was excellent, with a variety of cheeses, dips, and meats to share. If you have a short attention span, the Gathering Board is a solid choice. The Cured Salmon was probably my favorite. The flavors were subtle and rich - they mix an egg yolk in there to increase the silkiness. Finally, the Whipped Ricotta acted more as a dessert. As a ricotta hater, I was pleasantly surprised by it. It was my least favorite but still solid.---Circumstances play a big part in how good food tastes.

Gather is understated and immediately feels like a friendly neighborhood spot. Most importantly, I was blown away by the service-- everyone from the welcoming hostess, to our super-informative and witty waitress Jamie, to the bartender who took the time to explain to us what Cynar is (and how to pronounce it properly), and finally to our bus staff who never rushed us and always kept our area clean. We had a wonderful table out in their back patio, which by the way is amazing. Tucked away off the street, it's very quiet and private from any neighbors. There's a nice roof which I imagine comes in handy during the summer sun, has some pretty greenery and hedges along with some cute lights to set the mood. Gather is a wine bar, so naturally we began with cocktails and moved to a bottle of red wine later in the evening. Our waitress, Jamie, helped us through the menu as there were about 10-12 items that caught our eye.Ultimately, we settled on the whipped ricotta appetizer, beet salad, brussels sprouts, curry gnocchi (special of the evening) and the siroloin steak. All the items were delivered very thoughtfully -- paired appropriately, delivered at the perfect time intervals, and they even split the sirloin steak for us without our asking. All of the food was equally unique and special. They have an open kitchen, and it was very cool to walk past and see the effort and time spent on each dish by the chefs. We absolutely loved the brussels sprouts, and the whipped ricotta with honey and balsamic was a treat and dessert in itself. I cannot wait to be back.

Our server asked us at the start of the meal if we had any requests/allergies and we told her we had a vegetarian in the party (not a pescatarian). \u00a0We started with the brussel sprouts but she served them with the bonito flakes (fish). \u00a0We reminded her of the vegetarian in our party so she brought us another serving sans fish. \u00a0These were delicious, perfectly flavored with parmagiano. We also ordered the ricotta with honey and balsamic. \u00a0This was great too, the cheese itself is mild so the honey was a great compliment. \u00a0For entrees we had burgers (nice flavor but the bun was overpowering), gnocchi (very small portion but it is listed on the menu as an appetizer and just okay flavor) and the Spaghetti Alla Chitarra. For desserts we had the apple fritters. \u00a0Overall, this is a great spot if you're looking for a nice neighborhood dinner with a very creative menu.", "user_name": "Kate P.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=skwRIdt3h5mB69zo2K9V3A"}, {"review_date": "9/29/2016", "review": "I've been to Gather about 5 times now and I am never disappointed.

For Gather I feel a few comments are required and deserving. I made my reservation a month prior to the date of our dinner. On the day of our dinner we received both a text message and a telephone call to remind us of our reservation. OK, I get it. They want to fill their tables. But it was a little overkill. Upon arrival we were refused to be seated on the patio until our entire party was present. This was where things went spiraling down. I never want to be that guy, but this was infuriating. I approached the manager who was also the host to ask why we could not have a table and for a little accommodation. After all I am in the service business and spend my days accommodating my clients requests and circumstances. I received nothing but a recital of the house policies and a forced smile. Granted, each time the manager repeated herself I became more irritated. Having scored a parking spot in front of the restaurant and it being a Friday night we decided not to leave and wait for our friends.I am glad I did. Rachel, the bar tender, nicely defused the situation and mixed several very nice cocktails. I would have been very happy to have Rachel serve us dinner had we just been a party of two. Thank you Rachel !Our friends did arrive and we asked to be seated on the patio. My friend the manager said that a table was being \u00a0cleared \u00a0and if we waited 15 minutes and had a drink she wailed get us to that table.The patio was very nice, albeit a bit loud.

We only had to wait around 20-25 minutes to get seated which was really nice! The restaurant is really cool inside with multiple bars (including one up against the kitchen) and a variety of different table sizes. We sat out back in the outdoor patio which was awesome. Ivy covered walls surround the shaded patio and there are fun big-bulb light strands hung up around the perimeter.Service was solid, nothing special. We ordered a sticky bun to start with (delicious) but it didn't come until our entrees did, which I thought the waiter should have mentioned. That is my only complaint though! Gather still gets a 5 star rating from me because the food was delicious! We ordered the flatjacks, the french toast and the skillet. Everything looked and tasted outstanding. My french toast had blueberries and lemon scented ricotta on top which was a great combination. Every entree we saw brought out to the patio looked great; I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu!This is a fantastic brunch option in Lincoln Square.
