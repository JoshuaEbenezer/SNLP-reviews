"This restaurant got great reviews so we must have been there on a very off night.  I called ahead and made a reservation and told them it was for my sister's birthday, so they knew it was somewhat special.  Although the place was practically empty we got stuck in the back room which reeked of kerosene and was freezing at foot level and boiling at head level.  Three out of the four of us did not like our entrees.  The service was pretty good though and the price wasn't awful, but never again.","12/17/2016","1.0 star rating","dHv69W6ANxlKxLXnmgRtwQ","Ann S."
"Not very accommodating. We had a reservation for 6 and at the last minute needed to change it to 7.  We were told very coldly that there was no way they could add another seat for us. So...we left.  They missed out on a huge bill! Went across the street to a French Bistro and had a positively wonderful dinner!!!!","4/27/2015","1.0 star rating","_PVCxgNyEN0F6nt1irhIQA","Peggy B."
"Food was great but atmosphere and service could improve. whole restaurant was noisy and busy. on the website it says kids aren't allowed but when we got here there was few families with kids. our dinner was good but couldn't hear anybody at the table. even though the food was amazing the noise ruined it.","8/3/2016","2.0 star rating","-lg_Ny2kTwA2I2br_1GsIQ","Izzy L."
"Great brunch menu, with something for everyone. I had the fried chicken and waffles which were to die for. Service was a bit lackluster though, as many tables around us were served, ate and paid before us, although we had been seated before them; our waitress seemed a bit distracted throughout the meal. Despite the service I'll probably return for the killer food.","9/16/2015","3.0 star rating","fYHZir8R1Q4D0CwU8YsNLw","Audrey S."
"Been to Gather many times and loved the food.. My wife made reservations at 7p for my birthday....we walked in and right away were told they were running late. At 7:40 we were given a choice of a group table with stools, or continue to wait for the table they had hoped to be vacant at 7p.  Both choices were unacceptable.  We finally sat down after 8p.  Needless to say ... The night was wrecked.   Our tip reflected it...but we got a free desert.  Thanks a lot !","3/5/2015","3.0 star rating","qUkdNocbZNNjTAqi3VJF4Q","William S."
"A good experience.The cocktails we tried (the Jazz Man & the Count) were quite good. The Gathering Board was fun to share--a good variety. I thought the octopus was slightly-too-charred. The scallops and beets dish was well received. I thought the ""Spaghetti alla Chitarra"" dish was too cheese-heavy (--maybe just a case of misplaced expectations or ignorance, but I didn't expect the spaghetti to be in a pool of cheese sauce). The cheesecake and the beignet desserts were good, but not exceptional. The wine list was appropriate.Service was very good, and the atmosphere was just what we were looking for: lively but intimate.","2/9/2014","3.0 star rating","cjmk-bcbH25m_BhdqS0Avg","Ben T."

"I came in the midst of warm weather, this season and found the back oasis a treat. The covered outdoor area was arranged perfectly to host a handful of small groups. It felt very tucked away, and even though the voices bounced around making it louder than it should have been, the charcuterie spread was well worth it. The portions of meats were huge, actually most of their  dishes. I'll be back for another wonderful snack.","7/21/2016","4.0 star rating","orQnFpng3NpvyGuJ5P9FRw","Salvador I."
"A group of four of us went for dinner on a Friday night. We didn't know they had a beautiful back patio, but maybe one day, I can snag a table and sit out there.The cocktails were lovely! They had a diverse mix and will tell you more about them if you ask to help you make better decisions. The fruity ones were lovely without being too sweet. We enjoyed the beet salad and the ricotta spread on bread a lot! Also, I adored the halibut. It was fine since we shared and two of us were halibut fans and the other two loved the scallops.  We also had the pasta with a variety of mushrooms which was nice, but not especially noteworthy. There is a little open kitchen and they crank out food. You can sit right there and watch the action.I will say that on a weekend the place was really loud! It was really crowded.Also really enjoyed the apple fritters for dessert. The fruit in the strawberry rhubarb crisp/crumble was great, but the topping was ok. The dessert portions were generous and great for sharing. I went with a pescetarian and I will say that when the meat was on the side, it didn't really take much away. So I would recommend this Lincoln Square spot for anyone who wants to enjoy some fine cuisine and cocktails in a trendy environment.I am curious about their breakfast/brunch offerings.","7/17/2016","4.0 star rating","AraTKD3kUD5_ZtzSi4Hgqw","K W."

"Seriously speaking, Gather has captures the hearts of many. Why? Well, its obviously because of the list of good quality wines in their wine bar. Not only the wines but also with their nice twist of Whiskey smash, you night would be really ultra amazing.Good Music BackgroundGood romantic vibe, its kinda great to have this kind of atmosphere if you are with love ones.Im into seafood that night so I ordered Grilled Octopus, its kinda new to my taste, from top to bottom, I will give it 4 star.

"I meet up here with a friend for brunch and it was a delightful experience. They have plenty of vegetarian options which makes things very easy. I ended up going with the Benedict, which is a breakfast staple of mine that I usually go for. After looking at what came out of the kitchen (thanks to the counter seats) I wished I would have gone for the chicken and biscuits option. That aside I will have to admit I was still very satisfied with my meal. One of my eggs was slightly overcooked, not to the degree that I got upset about it but it was slightly over. I do like the use of the thin sliced ham in the place of the Canadian bacon. The bits of bacon over the top made the salt content absolutely perfect. I also got to taste a bit of my friends pork belly-free breakfast skillet. It was really good and the salsa was brilliant and added a nice acidity that I think would have went perfectly with the fatty pork belly. Yet and still you could tell that it was a substantial and satisfying dish.","4/19/2015","4.0 star rating","WdBQHjJ-_kyHnzZBSu_u1Q","Robert C."
"We got caught in the rain, and stopped in this restaurant by luck. It was a Sunday, and besides their regular menu they serve a family style dinner.  You get to choose from 6 entrees and several sides. Our foursome sampled almost all of them and the food and salads were fresh and outstanding. The service was also excellent. The seating is a little cramped but the meal was worth the small annoyance.

"Perfect restaurant, except for one server. I love Gather. It's become my new favorite restaurant. The food is always fantastic, and I appreciate their rotating menu, because even if I go multiple times a month (and I do) there's always something new to try. Their back patio is especially charming, and their brunch is one of the best in the city. All in all, Gather is practically perfect. However, I've had several negative experiences with one of their servers (Max) and frankly I'm surprised they still employ him. On my last visit we dined with him again, and though we are regulars and he's served us several times he asked us if it was our first visit (I only point this out because we go so frequently that the rest of the staff all know us). He then either forgot to order one of our dishes or left it on hold for too long, because we had a 20 minute wait for our last dish...which was a salad. And every time we wanted more water or to order more wine we had to struggle to flag him down. But the real reason I was upset enough to reactivate an old yelp account is that after confirming twice that my friend has a peanut allergy he served us a dessert with peanut ice cream, which she realized after taking a bite. He then made excuses that it was a new dish and he can't be expected to know all the ingredients yet. No, but you should damn well know the major allergens. To add to the absurdity of the situation we overheard the table behind us suffer the same fate - he served them a different dish which one of the guests was allergic to. My friend and I have both worked extensively in the industry, and I'm so disappointed to have these experiences at an otherwise fantastic restaurant. I can't stress enough how wonderful every other aspect of Gather is. Now it's just time for them to replace that one waiter and it will be truly perfect.","10/20/2016","5.0 star rating","XVNJJbLdXtaCzUAHxeRMhA","Raquel R."
"Gather is, simply put, one of the most spectacular restaurants in Chicago. This goes so far beyond merely having an incredible rotating menu of delicious food and drink- the staff at Gather are never less than brilliant and work hard to make sure that everyone has a fantastic experience.My husband and I were introduced to Gather by two of our best friends and since that first experience we've shared it with those closest to us as an opportunity to pay that experience forward. We recently had our small and intimate wedding and David went so far out of his way to make our post-wedding brunch absolute perfection. He worked with us to secure a spot for us at a time and date that worked for us and made the whole process effortless, we cannot thank him enough! On the day of everyone agreed it was one of the best dining experiences they'd ever have. Thank you all again for making our day even more special! Do yourself a favor: book a table and get yourself to Gather.Kudos also to servers Max and Jamie for being amazing on every visit!","8/29/2016","5.0 star rating","o5SYVuqWWqF9F7FZS6EzPg","James C."
"I ate here earlier tonight and it was sublime!!  Our server, I can't remember his name ( sorry!), but he was tall with glasses and swoopy black hair, was awesome.  His recommendations were spot on, and the service from everyone who touched our table, was impeccable.  I loved the food, especially the raviolo and the gnocchi!  I could have eaten a bucket of ravioli.  The flavors were well balanced and perfect.  Well done to all the staff, back and front of house.  I'll be back.","3/11/2016","5.0 star rating","u4IacBkfrKDyUHVPGrzxGw","Adrienne D."

"I went to Gather last night with two of my friends and we all three loved the place. We were looking for something new and different that we hadn't heard of, and thanks to the ' a la card ' we found the perfect spot! We decided to order a couple ""gather and share"" items to start and I can absolutely recommend the gnocchi! Then we all ordered a  different entree with the intent to share those as well, but we all loved our individual entrees so much that ""sharing"" ended up being a joke! That being said I can only comment on the chicken, which was delicious and a wonderful presentation. The service was great too. The only reason we won't be back right away is because we aren't close to the neighborhood, but will be a staple when I travel north! Go gather at Gather! You won't regret it.

"When the hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside (in November?) I thought she was joking. Wrong! The outdoor space was beautiful and warm. Plenty of heaters. Glad we sat out there. The server, Jamie, was really nice, friendly and helpful. She was very knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu. I had a ""Dark and Stormy"" cocktail- it was fantastic-rum and ginger beer and a few other ingredients. For appetizers we had the Honeycrisp Apple appetizer and the Uovo Raviolo. Both of them were amazing. It's not a burger place, but I ordered it anyway-great idea. Loaded with cheese, onions and bacon- it was delicious. Everything was perfect. One of the most amazing things is that almost every employee in the place was at our table at some point during the meal, dropping off a food item or a drink. We really didn't need dessert, but couldn't pass up the deep fried Apple Fritters with Ice Cream on top. It was ridiculous. Seriously. When we were leaving, absolutely every employee thanked us and told us to have a great night. Amazing. So rare to that many great employees in one place. I don't think I could have been more impressed. Highly recommend this place-can't wait to go back!","11/7/2015","5.0 star rating","sEzVZPRaFiXxcI4ExEH8fA","Ryan A."

In fact going there just for dessert would not be strange at all.  They offer some of the best ever.  I'm a chocolate person, but their apple fritters may have changed me forever. There is a beautiful outdoor patio.  We sat indoors with our reservation.  Even though it was crowded, it was not too loud.  I have heard the brunch here is spectacular too.

"My friend and I decided to stop by for after dinner drinks on Sunday, it was great!  We sat at the bar and ordered some cocktails.  Our bartender was very friendly and took great care of us, we felt taken care of.  Even though we were full from our dinner, we decided to order some appetizers since the menu looked so good.  I am glad that we did!  The Whipped Ricotta and the Yellow Fin Tuna Tartare was delicious!  The tuna was so fresh.  We would definately go back, not just for the food but for the service!  Great addition to the Lincoln Square neighborhood.","10/22/2013","5.0 star rating","cyDq8N3XyYrvPFySk7LG2Q","Mary D."
"Just got back from a Sunday night dinner for four. The food was so excellent that I just had to give this restaurant a big shout-out!The restaurant was half-full, service was friendly and prompt, and the General Manager personally delivered the meals. Atmosphere was contemporary and comfortable. The menu was pretty limited...but as it turns out that was no problem, because literally everything we ordered was delicious.Two thumbs up for: Homemade Ricotta with Honeycomb, Mixed Green Salad (you wouldn't think that something this basic could get rave reviews), Steamed Mussels (delicious broth), Roasted Chicken (very moist), and Halibut -- and Sticky Buns for dessert.The only thing that was not quite as perfect (but still quite good) were the Pappardelle with Fava Beans, Peas, Maitake Mushrooms and Asparagus in a very light cream sauce. The taste was actually quite good, but the texture didn't quite work. With wide noodles like pappardelle, you need something that can ""cling"" to the pasta a bit better, and the asparagus spears were just too big a scale.  The combination was unusual and creative, but I think this recipe requires a bit more tweaking.Bottom line -- fabulous meal, reasonable price point. We'll be back and will recommend to friends.","6/23/2013","5.0 star rating","7u9I5kR7AuK8W1tkwpmOwQ","Marco H."

"Had an amazing meal and enjoyed great service.  So happy to have a restaurant in the neighborhood that is welcoming.  The brussel sprouts were fantastic as well as the porchetta and who could forget the sticky buns!  Will definitely be back.","1/7/2013","5.0 star rating","rGrlR0XnLnHVQWHeCVy_4A","Clark B."

"Great value for a nice meal!  Went one of the first nights Gather was open, and I was really impressed at how upscale my meal turned out to be for such a good price.  Wife and I shared a few plates from the Gather (sharing) menu and then each had a prime entree.  We left full and really enjoyed the wine, and were out the door at a great price.  Highly recommend!","12/11/2012","5.0 star rating","3b-3pLjt6lDWf0czG1kt8Q","Jason G."
"Really enjoyed the pork sandwich I had as well as the salami and cheese plate. The vegetarian offerings looked good as well and I can't wait to come back and try.Great wine selection.
