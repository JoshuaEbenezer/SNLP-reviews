We enjoyed the beet salad and the ricotta spread on bread a lot! Also, I adored the halibut. It was fine since we shared and two of us were halibut fans and the other two loved the scallops. \u00a0We also had the pasta with a variety of mushrooms which was nice, but not especially noteworthy. There is a little open kitchen and they crank out food. You can sit right there and watch the action.I will say that on a weekend the place was really loud! It was really crowded.Also really enjoyed the apple fritters for dessert. The fruit in the strawberry rhubarb crisp/crumble was great, but the topping was ok. The dessert portions were generous and great for sharing. I went with a pescetarian and I will say that when the meat was on the side, it didn't really take much away.

I love Gather. It's become my new favorite restaurant. The food is always fantastic, and I appreciate their rotating menu, because even if I go multiple times a month (and I do) there's always something new to try. Their back patio is especially charming, and their brunch is one of the best in the city. All in all, Gather is practically perfect. However, I've had several negative experiences with one of their servers (Max) and frankly I'm surprised they still employ him. On my last visit we dined with him again, and though we are regulars and he's served us several times he asked us if it was our first visit (I only point this out because we go so frequently that the rest of the staff all know us). He then either forgot to order one of our dishes or left it on hold for too long, because we had a 20 minute wait for our last dish...which was a salad. And every time we wanted more water or to order more wine we had to struggle to flag him down. But the real reason I was upset enough to reactivate an old yelp account is that after confirming twice that my friend has a peanut allergy he served us a dessert with peanut ice cream, which she realized after taking a bite. He then made excuses that it was a new dish and he can't be expected to know all the ingredients yet. No, but you should damn well know the major allergens. To add to the absurdity of the situation we overheard the table behind us suffer the same fate - he served them a different dish which one of the guests was allergic to. My friend and I have both worked extensively in the industry, and I'm so disappointed to have these experiences at an otherwise fantastic restaurant.

One of the most amazing things is that almost every employee in the place was at our table at some point during the meal, dropping off a food item or a drink. We really didn't need dessert, but couldn't pass up the deep fried Apple Fritters with Ice Cream on top. It was ridiculous. Seriously. When we were leaving, absolutely every employee thanked us and told us to have a great night. Amazing. So rare to that many great employees in one place. I don't think I could have been more impressed. Highly recommend this place-can't wait to go back!", "review_date": "11/7/2015", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Ryan A.", "user_id": "sEzVZPRaFiXxcI4ExEH8fA"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "11/29/2014", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Tim C.", "user_id": "VvHXq7k5GTfnjFCGxA85iA"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "1/16/2014", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "TR C.", "user_id": "Y8w6WW3_dtqfaUnNRSwn3w"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "12/17/2013", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "TR C.", "user_id": "Y8w6WW3_dtqfaUnNRSwn3w"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "8/28/2013", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "user_name ": "TR C.", "user_id": "Y8w6WW3_dtqfaUnNRSwn3w"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "1/12/2015", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Alexander N.", "user_id": "0x_Jzyg4LRxDaX3Yzq144A"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "11/9/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Amy W.", "user_id": "mqAgD7G8IsJqn_6SSC703Q"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "1/22/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Shel B.", "user_id": "IiUhKdYxWi48qfsGOlMI7g"}, {"review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "1/8/2015", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Tom W.", "user_id": "sF9N8L_PetduE5DeORQ6Lw"}, {"review": "Excellent brunch, and all other meals.

The menu was pretty limited...but as it turns out that was no problem, because literally everything we ordered was delicious.Two thumbs up for: Homemade Ricotta with Honeycomb, Mixed Green Salad (you wouldn't think that something this basic could get rave reviews), Steamed Mussels (delicious broth), Roasted Chicken (very moist), and Halibut -- and Sticky Buns for dessert.The only thing that was not quite as perfect (but still quite good) were the Pappardelle with Fava Beans, Peas, Maitake Mushrooms and Asparagus in a very light cream sauce. The taste was actually quite good, but the texture didn't quite work. With wide noodles like pappardelle, you need something that can \"cling\" to the pasta a bit better, and the asparagus spears were just too big a scale. \u00a0The combination was unusual and creative, but I think this recipe requires a bit more tweaking.Bottom line -- fabulous meal, reasonable price point.
