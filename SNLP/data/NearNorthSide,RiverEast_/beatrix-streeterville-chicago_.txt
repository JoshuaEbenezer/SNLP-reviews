I imagine that if I still worked in this area this would be a great spot on the weekday to run in for a muffin and a coffee. \u00a0The pastries at the coffee bar looked amazing. However, I am writing this review based on a brunch experience I had here with a group. \u00a0Frist of the entry way is set up terribly. \u00a0there is no where to stand and a revolving door make this even more terrifying. \u00a0We had a reservation and we still had to wait a good 15 minutes for our table which is so annoying especially with a big group! Once we were seated it took FOREVER for a server to come and we didn't get water until she came. \u00a0Its WEEKEND BRUNCH, PEOPLE ARE HUNGOVER! Please give them water. \u00a0She also never refilled out water container after it was empty. \u00a0She asked for drinks. \u00a0Most got coffee, I got a cappuccino, and a friend got a chocolate milk. \u00a0The Cappuccino took a REALLY long time to come out, but not as long as the chocolate milk??? like what are you doing? \u00a0Anyway the Cappuccino was luke warm at best and the foam had deflated probably from sitting in a window for so long it looked like a shot of espresso more than a full coffee, which I think was like $5. \u00a0The food was okay, but the portions are kind of small. \u00a0I don't remember having this experience at the River North location. \u00a0I actually remember LOVING my experience and food at the RN location. \u00a0I then heard they are opening up another location in the west loop? \u00a0Idk seems like they are getting a little big for their britches (even though it is a LEYE restaurant). \u00a0They should scale back the streeterville location. \u00a0I don't think they will do well trying to compete with great places like Little Goat in the West Loop.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-y5VMiDGTiwDWhWqC-h7Tg"}, {"user_name": "Lauren C.", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "review_date": "4/11/2017", "review": "I had high hopes for this place, but generally I was left with a, \"just ok\" feeling. The restaurant is enormous; it has a nice layout, and the rooms are slightly broken up, but still keep a relatively open feel. For a Friday night, it was not too terribly crowded, but given the size, I guess that wasn't a huge surprise. Drinks were alright; I ordered an old fashioned, which was good, but nothing special. Other tablemates had a margarita (good...it has some heat to it, which was tasty). Another had their flavored cucumber soda water, which she really enjoyed. The food was ok...I tried the neatloaf; in concept it was good...there was a heavy amount of sage, which drowned out the flavor of the sweet potato. The meat was also VERY salty...the kale that came with it was over-dressed in butter and salt (it tasted like movie theatre pop corn!) and the mashed potatoes were nothing special. My roommate got a chicken dish similar to a chicken francese; it lacked crispiness, but the flavor was really good! Dessert was definitely the highlight. We split a caramel pie dessert, which was very yummy, and the chocolate cake, which was also quite tasty. Coffee was hit or miss. Two people in the party got regular, black coffee which was luke warm and had clearly come from a pot sitting around for a while. I got their latte drink which boasted a sprinkling of cayenne pepper; the coffee was great, and I love spicy food, but they definitely overdid it with the cayenne; it killed the flavor....with the lukewarm coffee, the issue was resolved quickly, and management removed the cost of the coffee from our bill.Decent service, and just ok food...with all the great options available, this is probably not a place i'd come back to any time soon.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dzbAnL-XttlCC4DaocD0xA"}, {"user_name": "Lisa A.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "4/3/2017", "review": "If you have ever had a an appointment at Northwestern hospital or one of the surrounding clinics, chances are you've walked past Beatrix.

Well for starters, this is not a casual restaurant in the sense of sweatshirts and oh, I don't, know combat boots. Beatrix is a classy kind of place where you'll feel most comfortable in business causal. So take it from me, as someone who came in off the street because their friend loved this place and everyone was hungry and cold and it was like 8pm on a Saturday: don't show up in combat boots and a Harry Potter sweatshirt. You will feel like you're insulting the restaurant. Okay now that I've gotten that out of the way: the food here is amazing. For an appetizer we ordered their fries. And if you're me, who had never been there before, you may be like \"Fries? What's special about fries?\" Well, my friend, these are amazing. Seasoned perfectly. And they have fried lemon slices! And they are amazingly delicious. And I want more of them in my life. For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Bebe and it was the most delicious piece of chicken I've ever had. The Parmesan crust was delicious and the chicken was cooked so it basically melted in your mouth. And the asparagus was cooked perfectly - wasn't too mushy and wasn't too crunchy. My friends ordered the ravioli and a special (Rigatoni with red quinoa Bolognese). The ravioli is amazing but if that special ever appears on the menu again, I highly recommend it. The sauce was perfect.Overall, I definitely enjoyed my experience here. The food was amazing and the service was also excellent. You're going to pay around $25 per person (not including drinks) but it's well worth it. I normally balk at meals that are more than $15 because rarely are they worth it.

I ordered the \"Straight A Salad\" since I was not in the mood for a particularly heavy meal.The salad was actually decent tasting, but it wasn't anything special.

It made us feel bad for complaining because he is clearly dedicated to customer service and ensuring that patrons are well attended to. He came over several times to check on us after he personally brought us new plates; and he also gave us dessert on the house, which we didn't expect or ask for. ---The taco bar was awesome--unlimited tacos with very fresh ingredients and either grilled chicken or chicken tinga (pulled chicken)--both were marinated very well. Tons of toppings to put in your tortilla to include multiple salsas, sour cream, fresh guac, etc. I ended up getting full after 2 tacos, but I liked it because I was able to eat more veggies! It wasn't anything extra special... but then the dessert...AMAZING. we try not to order dessert too often, but we would've missed out had the manager not recommended these. ---The lemon pie was great--not too sour, not too sweet (and I generally don't like it), the crust tasted very good as well. and then omg..... ---the Pumpkin Pecan pie.... I have never eaten anything like it, and I don't think I'll ever find it again, so I may have to come back here just for this. The pumpkin was whipped and had a light and flowy texture but with all the pumpkin spicy goodness of the fall; and this was perfectly balanced with the thinner-than-usual (which is good!!) layer of pecan pie, which gave the whole pie the sugary sweetness that you love in pies, without overwhelming you like normal pecan pies do. The whipped cream went excellent with it as well. You HAVE to try this. Overall, the manager handled the situation very well.

That being said, I believe in giving all restaurants an equal chance...they all serve food which are waiting to be reviewed by people like you and me.

I got the Kung Pao Brussels to start. These were amazing. Packed with flavor and had a nice kick to them (so be warned if you're not a fan of spicy foods!). For my main course, I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake. This was also excellent...I love it when I cut into these with a fork and can see that it is densely packed with crab meat and not just filler. The persimmon salad served with it was also very good. It had a light dressing, the persimmons were just right, and it paired very nicely with the crab cake. Finally, for dessert we both ordered the Caramel Pie.Wow.When it was brought to the table, the lady who dropped it off told us that it was very good and that she loved it. I agree with her 100%. Insanely rich and dense. Even the crust was good (graham cracker with caramel, I believe). It was served with a dollop of whipped cream which helped to cut some of the sweetness. As was with all of the courses, they did not skimp on portions. We were very satisfied at the end of our meal.I should also mention that the service was great.

We got seated next to the bar kind of near the pastries instead of in the actual dining area, which was probably the only thing that bothered me seeing as everywhere else looked empty. \u00a0However maybe the other tables were all reserved. The place is cute and definitely seems more like a restaurant than a cafe but has great coffee shop options. I was able to get an iced soy chai latte with my dinner that was absolutely delicious. Only $3.85 too, which is pretty cheap. For my entree I got the escarole and potato ravioli, and it was fantastic!! It's basically a giant giant raviolo stuffed with cheese, potato, and comes with asparagus and it was really good and classy for what I would think I'd find at a cafe. Waiter was very attentive. Only critique is most of the dinner menu options are somewhat expensive, the raviolo I got was probably the cheapest ($16.95), but overall really great food and options and atmosphere.

I often describe this as such a \"girls\" restaurant mainly because the menu features things like power green juices, quinoa cakes, cauliflower grits, etc. There's definitely something for everyone, but it is such a nice (and much needed!) break from all the \"steak and potatoes\" restaurants that run rampant throughout Chicago. ANYWAY, here's what we had:Power Greens Juice - I'm not into juice, personally, but this was good. Note that you can add vodka to all of their fresh-squeezed juices :)Spiked Freddo - Liquor, coffee, chocolate. Synergy at its finest. Cauliflower Grits & Eggs - A surprisingly large portion. I love grits, and the cauliflower is remarkable. Light & Fluffy Lemon Pancakes - I had these during a different visit, but they deserve special mention. The lightest and fluffiest. Literally lemon clouds. Bea's Cheese Blintzes - I had been craving a blueberry cheese danish for over a month, and this finally satisfied my craving. Ugh these are done so well. Not too sweet or heavy, BUT I would recommend getting them for the table instead of as your entr\u00e9e. No one really needs to eat three blintzes...although I definitely did.Brown Sugar Bacon - We had 3 orders lol. Best bacon ever.There is a 100% chance that I will return.

I've walked through there so many times and have never seen a bartender. The front bar is ok but the way it is built is not ideal. It's not a comfortable spot to relax, drink, and dine. You have to kind of move your dirty dishes up so they can see them and take them away and they really can't reach down enough to serve the food properly. Very poor design for the front bar.The food is ok (pot roast sandwich was extremely forgettable and tasteless) but the reality is that I just don't want to work that hard. \u00a0There are so many Lettuce places nearby where I can enjoy a wonderful lunch with bar service.

The inside of this location is much larger than what it appears like from the outside so it's a pleasant surprise when you walk in and realize how much seating there actually is. We decided to share the lemon pancakes and the mushroom & quinoa burger. The pancakes were too soft and slightly soggy at first and maybe I got used to it but it grew on me about halfway through. I loved the lemony flavor though and also really liked the lemon syrup on the side. The mushroom & quinoa burger was a SOLID FIVE. My friend is a vegetarian and said it was possibly the best vegetarian burger she's ever had - even better than the veggie burger at Kuma's Corner! Although I haven't had that many vegetarian burgers, I'd have to agree that even on a regular burger spectrum, this burger was SPECTACULAR. The patty was freaking amazing and if they sold their patties, I'd buy it frozen to go. It's super juicy but healthy and full of flavor. In comparison, the fries on the side pretty much sucked. I've had their kennebec fries at the other Beatrix location and LOVED it so I'm not sure what happened here but the fries were so plain and flat. Not crispy at all! Thank god for the sriracha aioli! It's too bad the fries were awful or this would have been easily a 5 star review like the other location!Tip: Making reservations for the weekend would be helpful to prevent the long waits during peak brunch hours!

Not too loud, not too quiet, the perfect music volume to make it a pleasant experience. Food was ASTONISHING! I ordered the chicken tinga (with two sunny side-up eggs and avocado) and my wife ordered a healthier version of eggs Benedict (over a quinoa patty instead of an English muffin).

I was so blown away with the amount of healthy food offerings that I visited them three times opening week and since then, it's my most frequented restaurant in the world. \u00a0The Streeterville location offers something that you will not find at the original Beatrix and that is the Market and prepared foods counter. Being able to grab their healthy deliciousness to go is what has me the most excited because you are able to grab items that are not available on their menu. Located in the Market is a really cool chocolate bar, a beautiful and vibrant salad bar, and hot items available for those that are on the go and do not have time to sit and dine. A few things offered in their prepared foods aisle are chicken sausage, egg and cheese burritos and corn muffins filled with eggs and cheese...what?! I am a modified vegan and Beatrix offers the BEST vegan cookies I have ever had and guess what? They're offered in the Market as well as inside the restaurant at the coffee bar. You don't want to sleep on their honey butter cinnamon rolls because if this location is as crazy as the original, they do NOT last.
