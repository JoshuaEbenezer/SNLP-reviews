They take reservations and I was able to grab a same-day rez no problem. I started off with a martini bc it's been a VERY long day at McCormick Convention Center. The Bee's Knees martini was fantastic. I got the cornbread that seems to be all the rave, and quite honestly it was just OK. I would give this a miss next time. I thought it was dry and didn't really taste like anything. I have had excellent jalape\u00f1o cornbread before, full of flavor, so I know it can be done. I ordered the Macho salad (minus the chicken) and this was just dynamite. If I could have this salad every single day, I would be a happy girl. Then I ordered the banana cream pie bc it had to be done and bc work was buying.

It was a Sunday afternoon yet it was still jam packed. So definitely make reservations if you're coming during a popular time as it's right in the heart of Michigan Ave so things get quite busy over here. Unfortunately we were not there for their Jazz which they have in the evenings but I will have to try that next time. We started out with their tasty corn bread on a skillet and that's a must get over here, don't even debate that one second and just order it. It was a pretty big portion for us to share. We then each got the macho salad which was absolutely divine. I seriously think it's one of my favorite salads in Chicago now. Wish there was a bandera in the burbs as I always go to Wildfire for the chopped salad but I think I may have actually liked this one a tad more.We were super full from each having a salad as the portion was pretty large so we could have even shared and gotten a dessert. I really wanted to try their banana cream pie as it looked divine from a table next to us. We also had a seat by the window which was nice because it can get a little dark in the middle of the restaurant. Our server was super sweet and we had good service, so truly what's not to like.

Fortunately, the bartender told us that they were featuring the banana cream pie that night, so even though it wasn't on the menu, we could order it. Phew, crisis averted.Now, let's talk about the bcp. Hands down, the best pie I have EVER eaten in my entire life. It was phenomenal. Creamy custard, fluffy homemade whipped cream, crunchy golden brown graham cracker crust, caramel drizzle over everything, and some sliced bananas on the side. Hoo boy. We ate every single crumb on the plate, and damn near licked it clean that pie was so good. The only thing that caused me to subtract a star was the price: $11 for a piece of pie? That seems kinda greedy, Bandera. And the pie slice couldn't have been more than 1/6 of the full pie. But, service was excellent, and this may just be one of the quality over quantity places.One final plus of the place: they have a live jazz trio!

All staff I've interacted with were courteous and pleasant. At peak hours they can become a little inattentive, e.g. neglecting our water glasses.AMBIANCE is suitable for romantic, business or special occasion dinners. It's on the noisier (not raucous) side, as they have live jazz every night and it's amazing.

It was packed with people and the live Jazz music was on. It was a classy and elegant restaurant with dim lighting. I ordered mojito, grilled artichokes, Rotisserie chicken with a side of cucumber and a hand made Oreo ice cream sandwich. They did an excellent job on the appetizer. The artichokes were grilled perfectly with light sea salt and amazing dipping sauce. The chicken was juicy and moist and the salad was similar like Mediterranean style. To be honest, I was pretty full after the entree but I got to have a dessert for my birthday. It was amazing! I couldn't stop eating. Every bite of food was joy. Compliment to the chef.

It's quite a bit of cornbread--too much for only two people, but the perfect amount for four. The salad was delicious!! Shredded greens, chopped egg, and an incredibly flavorful vinaigrette. It was a great choice. The prime rib was HUGE. It was a thick cut of meat, and it was bone in. The cod was good, but was overpriced for the small portion.You should definitely consider splurging on a bottle of wine. The wine list isn't very extensive, but they have a selection of great producers and beautiful wines at extremely cheap prices. I couldn't believe how affordable the prices were.

My party all chose from the entree list, or one of the entree specials our server told us about. The only thing that was a little off was the cornbread as a starter. It had bitter clumps in it- i think baking soda that hadn't been mixed in. My entree- a NY strip, was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The veggie sides were fresh and well seasoned. I didn't have dessert, but they sounded fantastic!

Service - the hostess was friendly and seated me quickly. The waitress that took my drink and food order was friendly and helpful about menu selections. The waitress that ended up being my actual waitress was nice but it was awkward since she came in after the fact (I think she may have been slightly late for her shift). The service was good overall but I felt that I was rushed out of the restaurant. I was trying to finish a glass of wine and ordered an espresso so I could sit a bit longer and finish my wine. The check was brought over with the espresso so I took that as a hint to leave. I moved over to the bar to finish my glass of wine (truth be told I'm a slow drinker). Food - good.

I debated an app and was glad I didn't - the burger was very filling! The burger patty is beet-based so when it arrived it almost looked like a meat patty.

After mopping up with a knife and fork I went to town on the second half. The trick is to leave the little pins holding it together as long as you can, and eat around the edge going for the parts that are in imminent danger of falling apart.The burger overall was good but not life changing. It was missing a certain something...I couldn't truly say what. The buttered burger bun was quite good though.The saut\u00e9ed spinach on the side was good - not overcooked or soggy, plenty of little garlic bits.Service was great. Attentive and friendly.

We ended up settling on this place due to another place having an hour-and-a-half wait. I should have known in Chicago it is good to call for reservations on a Saturday night especially a holiday Saturday night. We arrived and the place was packed! \u00a0we were told by the hostess that it would be around an hour wait but we could stop by the bar for drinks. The wait turned out not to be an hour, it turned out to be about 25 minutes which was good.Service:The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that their service was impeccable. From the time we stepped into the door, there was a smiling hostess and smiling maitre d. Once we got to our table our waiteress (Michelle I believe) didn't disappoint as well. She was very attentive and took care of all of our needs. She was very nice and open and we really enjoyed the hospitality of the place. The staff worked really well together to take care of each table; sometimes someone else brought us out of refills or someone else brought us our entrees, we really did not have to wait or ask for anything.AmbienceThe place is beautiful, it's nestled right on Michigan Avenue so very busy busy location. \u00a0Inside has a really nice romantic feel, the lights for dinner were dimmed \u00a0down low but you can tell that the room was very nicely laid out. One of the things that we really enjoyed was that they had a live piano player who was accompanied by a guitarist. \u00a0The pianon guy played beautifully, lots of old songs and new songs of different genres. It was such a nice background to our dinner. \u00a0The piano player does accept tips and also accepts request as well and unlike some places where the live musicians get annoyed when people ask for request whenever anyone asked of him he always had a smiling face and let them know that if you would be able to play or not.FoodThis is the area is where we ended up being disappointed. We ordered an appetizer which was the house-made cornbread. This was very delicious, very plentiful, and one of the highlights of the dinner. For my entree, I ordered the house special which consisted of baked group with lemon butter sauce, crispy shrimp on top, a side of chive mashed potatoes. \u00a0The dish was suppose to come with broccoli, however I was able to sub that for extra mashed \u00a0potatoes \u00a0at no charge. \u00a0The fish was tender but very bland :( \u00a0and the lemon butter sauce added no additional \u00a0flavor. \u00a0I tried putting \u00a0pepper on the dish to season it up but that didnt help much. \u00a0The mashed potatoes \u00a0were mixed in with chive, however, it was over kill and it totally \u00a0overpowered the taste of the potatoes. \u00a0The dish overall was a disappoint, in addition, it came out Luke warm which is never good.My husband ordered the roasted pork loin that came with the mashed potatoes and red cabbage. \u00a0His pork was very delicious (flavorful) and tender. \u00a0I think I enjoyed \u00a0his dish better than mine lol. \u00a0he the cabbage was ok and felt the same about the potatoes \u00a0that I did. \u00a0Again, his was Luke warm as well. \u00a0The pork was the warmest on his plate.Our family friend ordered the French dip sandwich. It tasted ok but again it came out just warm so 5 min into dinner it was cold.Dessert They had a house made oreo cookie ice cream sandwich. \u00a0It came with 2 cookies and was enough \u00a0to share. \u00a0This was the second \u00a0highlight of the meal. \u00a0The flavors of the dish blended in very well. Everyone \u00a0thought it was very yummy.With 2 glasses of wine, 1 app, 3 entrees, 1 desert; the bill came out to $124 . \u00a0Overall, the restaurant \u00a0has all the right \u00a0qualities to make it a 4 or 5 star, they just need to improve on the food aspect. \u00a0We won't \u00a0be dinning back due to for the price the food was lackluster and the surplus of restaurant options in Chicago for the same price range.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t43aBwH2E_OiR3_CBuhC-w", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "user_name": "Mia B."}, {"review_date": "4/10/2017", "review": "We've been to this location about 4x now and have had great experiences here every time.

Our server (also a manager) Vimova was spectacular and really made our time great! Great conversation, great recommendations! Artichokes (my favorite item) were out of season unfortunately but my husband and I loved our kale salad on the house because they no longer had his favorite item. My burger was extremely filling and I had to take some of it home as the portions are HUGE. Over all I would recommend Bandera to all! After yesterday I have no more reluctandencies!

Called and made a reservation for moms birthday and decided to go with this restaurant since reviews were amazing, food looked amazing and they had live jazz. They definitely were off their A game this night. Called and had reservations at 730, told them it was a special tonight as we were celebrating a big birthday. Seated right away which was good, host was not that welcoming, had to reassure them we were celebrating a birthday just to make sure the night went well. Once seated, things just didn't seem to get better. The waiter was young and didn't look like he liked this job - you're a waiter - smile a little. We ordered drinks that came out sporadically. The cocktails we ordered came out first but what made me upset is when granny ordered orange juice. It came out almost 15 minutes later then when she tried it, it was so sour and full of pulp. We had to order her something else and when we told John, the waiter that never smiles, he said that's how OJ taste then walked away. That makes sense why he's so sour if he thinks orange juice is supposed to taste sour. Overall the food was amazing. I can't complain with the chef as everyone really did enjoy the food. We had the pork, chicken and ribs, all very flavorful. When we were about finished with our entree - \"about finished\" - the unhappy waiter came over and prematurely took our plates away without even asking if we were done. I was still munching on my damn fries John. When my husband ASKED for the dessert menu, he didn't give us one, instead told us. Fine. Then we asked to order the apple a la mode, server looked surprised we were ordering dessert. That's when I just had to ask him did he know that we were celebrating moms birthday, hence why we want dessert for her special day. He said he didn't know, where the heck is the communication with the host and server. Even though the meal was delicious - there are so many places in Chicago that has amazing food.

A couple of our favorite starters from there appear here. The spinach artichoke dip is creamy, and served with sturdy tortilla chips perfect for dipping. Also included are sour cream and a salsa with just a hint of heat. House smoked salmon is very smokey, delicate and flaky, served with crisp toast and a mayo and dill based spread.Bandera's Caesar salad isn't for purists, as it uses kale, and the croutons are made from a fairly sweet corn bread. Ours were heavily over-dressed, but when the waitress noticed we weren't enjoying them she immediately had them remade with about one fifth the dressing, and they were much better.A house specialty is the enchilada, which is available with steak or a la carte. It's a bit unusual in that it's stuffed with squash, but is quite creamy, cheesy and satisfying.Much of the menu is given over to burgers and other sandwiches, so the price for dinner and a show can be quite reasonable.

The au jus it came with was pretty good but I think the bread was my least favorite thing.. There is a fine line between being toasted and just dry and old.. and I thought the bread was dry and old.

My boyfriend had been planning a date for weeks during our vacation/business trip in Chicago. He raved on and on about the excellent menu choices, a signature dessert, and the thing that swoons me away the most, live jazz. Main Entrees: Bandera met all those expectations and more. I ordered the daily Fresh Fish with Lemon Butter (the one that comes with crispy rock shrimp, broccoli, and mashed potatoes) and it hit the spot! My favorite part of restaurants and dishes is where there is a variety of tastes and palettes, which this dish definitely had. My boyfriend ordered the tri-tip & butternut white cheddar enchilada (we always taste each other's dishes). Very tasty and the meat was perfectly cooked and the enchilada wasn't too cheesy or filling. Delicious and zesty sauce. I would order this next time! Dessert: Then the dessert came and of course we made room for the House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches. Never had anything like it and this dessert immediately jumped onto my top 5 of desserts tasted over the years. You could practically hear my boyfriend and I raving over this dessert and how great it tasted. Definitely something to come back for! Ambiance/Service/Music: The service was excellent. The waiter was friendly to when I realized they forgot to accommodate to an allergy (scallions in the mashed potatoes), and brought out a new side dish right away, scallion-free. The waiters cracked jokes to us and made it a good time. Music came out halfway into our dinner and even though we were sitting right next to the band, I was still able to carry on normal level conversation over a glowing view of North Michigan Ave's bustling streets. Tip for ambiance, no athletic wear or shirtless sleeves. Since this surprise date included trekking 5 hours prior in Chicago, we dressed for the exercising and were slightly under-dressed. Was still seated but will keep this in mind for next time! Overall: An excellent experience and date and I seriously applaud my boyfriend for finding this place.

As other Yelpers have noted it is served without butter, but it is moist and flavorful enough that butter is not needed. It is a little crumbly but not to the point where it's difficult to eat. For dinner my friends and I had the bbq beef back ribs, the pork filet, and the fish of the day. Everybody was very happy with their meal. Everything tasted great, portion sizes were generous, and presentation was good too. They were happy to do side substitutions at no extra charge, so I had spinach with my ribs instead of coleslaw. My husband and friend had the Oreo ice cream sandwich for dessert. I'm lactose intolerant so did not partake, but it looked delicious. My husband and I will definitely go back. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is that my husband said that his $13 old fashioned was very watered down. Disappointing to go to such a nice place and drop that much money on a drink and not get your money's worth.

Simple, but delicious as well. Its not too heavy , but not too light. The whole serving will definitely get you full. Dessert got the banana cream pie. I believe it was homemade, doesn't look like something you'd get from Baker's Square. The cream was thick like a custard and the crust was thicker than a traditional graham cracker crust.

I came here with a date expecting great things and a romantic evening - great location on Michigan Avenue? Sounds wonderful, right? WRONG. I was entirely underwhelmed. Came during the weekend and made a reservation to have a window table overlooking Michigan Ave. After a 20 minute wait (WITH a reservation?), we finally sat down.The jazz musicians were so loud that I couldn't even hear my date. When the server finally came and greeted us, she basically had to yell at us to make herself heard letting us know what the specials were that evening. We tried to order the grilled artichokes, but they were \"out\"? How do you run out of an appetizer at 7:00pm on a weekend? Whatever. We got the cornbread instead. It was very sweet, burnt on the edges but almost uncooked in the middle, and had no flavor of the green chilies that we saw in it.We then tried to order our entrees - I asked for the prime rib. Again, they were \"out\". I settled for the rotisserie chicken. My date tried to order the lamb sandwich - OUT! Once again. So she ordered the macho salad.Our food took at least 20 - 30 minutes to arrive. We were entirely finished with the cornbread and just kept waiting around listening to the blaring jazz players that were slowly giving me a headache. They were good, it was just SO LOUD! When our food finally came out, my chicken was dry and served in a pile of slop next to some dry rice. I don't even know what the puddle of brown goo was, but it was not listed on the menu that it was served in that. My date's salad came out with only four pieces of chicken. When you are paying what they charge for a salad, I would expect more than just four pieces of chicken. Also, while we were eating, our drinks sat empty, waiting to be refilled.We were disgusted with the low quality of service, bad food, loud jazz, and high prices.

At 20:00 hrs, I found it easy to find a parking spot for which I paid $0.80, on the curb. Yes, you've read right, not even a Washington. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the same building that houses Adriana Furs.The Atmosphere: A large dim room, lit by candle fires reflecting a large mirror, the atmosphere is soothed by a live jazz. From the open kitchen in the dining room, your nose can sample the fragrance of steaks grilling. The view onto Michigan is a conversation piece.Unfortunately, the ambiance stops short from being a romantic restaurant or bringing someone you would want to woe. The loudness of the music and the sixteen plus digital video cameras spread throughout the dining room will quickly kill the mood for intimacy. I am not kidding, what's up with Fort Knox?The Pricing: Although reasonable for a night in downtown Chicago (consider the real estate), it is overpriced for what you get. There are 5 appetizers from $7 (Queso Dip) to $15 (Tuna Poke with shrimp and avocado), with an average at $11.20. The daily soup is at $7 and side dishes are between $4 (cornbread and foccacia) and $6 (side salad). Their cornbread is excellent with a hint of jalapeno and cheddar cheese. The texture is between Boston Market's cornbread (on the dense side) and Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits (on the fluffy side. As an appetizer, it comes in a small skillet but, you can just order a slice.Then there are 8 Entree salads and sandwiches priced from $13 (for a veggie burger) to $18 (for a prime rib dip sandwich). The average price is $15.63. For vegetarians or those who can't eat meats other than Kosher or Halal, the price point is definitely a punishment when you tally up vegetarian apps at more than $10.The 13 dinner entrees are between $15 (vegetable platter) and $30 (steak filet). An average dinner is at $23.08 including the two unpriced market fish dinners. Tonight they were Halibut and Swordfish. Dinner prices are high when you consider that they do not come with bread, sides or soups and, they don't serve you water. For a piece of bread and a cup of soup, you'll need to add $7. For what you get, an Outback or a Gibson's would be a better choice.Finally, the two desserts are at $8 including an Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich pilled high and, a banana cream pie with caramel and chocolate. I had neither one because they were too much. And wine by the glass is $8.So the check can reasonably reach $40-$50 per person, plus 12% sales tax and a 20% tip, or a total experience at $60 per person.The people: are nice and welcoming. Melissa and Elbereth, the hostesses, and Inga, the blonde manager, were professional and pleasant. If it were just to see their faces, the visit would be enchanting.That is until you meet the other manager, I forgot her name, showing a definite degree of unhappiness and Jamilla, the bartender who got annoyed at my asking questions about the drinks. Her only suggestion was the margarita because it's pretty good. For pretty good margarita, I go to Applebee's or to Friday's. At $15, I want damn fabulous!The food: Although the menu offers a substantial diversity with vegetarian, pork, chicken, beef and fish selections, I was disappointed.Hispanic cuisines around the world are noted with an abundance of flavors and textures. They inherited recipes from every culture. In Spain, you'd find Roman, French, Arab, Phoenician and Greek influences. In the Philippines, you have Indian, Vietnamese and Chinese imports. In Mexico, ancient Mayan cultures left a wealth of culinary heritage in relations to chocolate, seafood, corn and all the potato substitute you are hungry for.So in a restaurant named Banderas, I suppose after Banderas Bay in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, you would expect a confluence of spices, herbs and seafood, women brightly dressed dancing the Argentinean tango or the Brazilian salsa and, a rhythmic music that heats up your blood thinned with a tropical rum or, some exotic agave tequila blend. I wanted some agua fesca with hibiscus, some horchata with pineapple or some hot chocolate chili drink. I was salivating for a marmite or a paella. I thought I was getting all the passions of the world on my plate.But absolutamente nada, nothing. It's like finding out you were adopted as your wife serves you the divorce paper, your car is impounded, your children are not yours, your house is flooded, some guy you hate is sleeping with your sister and your mom, you get robbed, you get fired from your job and the IRS shows up for a tax audit, all in five minutes right as you wake up in the morning. It takes time to absorb that there is something fundamentally wrong. Now you get it.My Caesar salad was OK although enhanced with cornbread croutons. And the dinner was nothing to brag about: a swordfish, some Spanish rice and a cucumber salad.

A little annoying, but ok.The second time, I went relatively late on a weeknight, maybe around 9 pm.

The food service is quick and efficient, but all you get are one word answers and minimal conversation. I was in town, traveling by myself and I sat at the bar. The veggie burger was incredible, best one around - so much flavor and a huge portion. The coleslaw was good, but not special. I wanted to get a piece of the famous cornbread, but I was told that they no longer serve it by the slice - only the whole skillet. I'm not sure what the rationale is for that?! I was not greeted by a hostess upon arrival - the bar staff was slow to acknowledge and take a drink order - my water glass was kept full, but I was never offered a second drink or dessert. I do not expect long conversations with the bartender, I know they are busy - but some personality would be nice. All of the servers were rushing around with no smiles - they looked super stressed.

Was looking for a nice sit down dinner without being exorbitantly overpriced, and this was it. The live jazz music made for an exceptional and unique dining experience, and the service was impeccable. All 3 of our dinners were great. I had the prime rib, others had the ribs and salmon. Surprisingly, the salmon turned out to be the best dish, yet all were extremely satisfying. Would suggest for a family or even getting together with professional friends. It's a great environment with a superb ambiance."}, {"review_date": "7/31/2016", "user_name ": "Diane S.", "user_id": "Z3WjSLSuUzUGWIHGgHChXw", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "I've done a nation-wide tour of nearly all of the Banderas, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. The experience at any Bandera is consistent- from the dim lighting to the great, professional service and the corn bread that will knock your socks off, Bandera is an old standby for me.Their burger is great (order med-rare to truly appreciate it!), the tuna poke (when in season) is my appetizer of choice, and I have a hard time being swayed away from the gorgeous seasonal veggie platter as my dinner entree (just be prepared to ingest Paula Deen-level amounts of buttah and salt). Yay Bandera!"}, {"review_date": "7/20/2016", "user_name ": "Mike K.", "user_id": "QnBAxottkJfsUj6Qy4d6YQ", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Just what we were looking for in Chicago"}, {"review_date": "3/1/2016", "user_name ": "Shazia S.", "user_id": "A17dGVggNbdgMIJeXket9g", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "12/27/2013", "user_name ": "Rebecca S.", "user_id": "cMbbpfHVwFVVsJER3z6lkg", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "6/28/2012", "user_name ": "Joslynn H.", "user_id": "69pvm7YxiLaUhH84mXhIiA", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "8/28/2009", "user_name ": "Faye N.", "user_id": "K_ODcv6dRxhE3lC6bWpVNw", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "5/5/2012", "user_name ": "Shawn K.", "user_id": "NRIyk7Vu9iq-PKbyZBVtpQ", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "8/31/2011", "user_name ": "Frank E.", "user_id": "QQmrJ1J8ceBAAzt-BYpe-Q", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "12/30/2009", "user_name ": "Dan C.", "user_id": "be_slDO5RJ2pnYkjxxDl-A", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "1/6/2015", "user_name ": "Kevin O.", "user_id": "WnQQENC4IqEBETP4Wmzw-g", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "11/29/2012", "user_name ": "Tyler F.", "user_id": "MKGwxC6_-6BUMSSqBGqL1Q", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}, {"review_date": "3/31/2012", "user_name ": "Mel L.", "user_id": "Rim4Lc3AKkqGs1eRk82jxg", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service"}], "fake_review_count": 220}
