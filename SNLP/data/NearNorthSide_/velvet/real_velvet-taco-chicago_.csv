"Came in to get the BDC (rotisserie chicken) on a Monday- was told 40 minutes. I said sure thing. After 43 minutes I go ask how much longer, the owner says 9 more minutes pointing to a timer. I ask, if you have it on a timer... Why tell me 40 minutes? He responds it's their third batch today. Not quite sure how that's relevant at all- really don't understand the blatant deception. I mean most places tell you longer than expected, but this man has the chicken on a legit timer and just lied.","1/23/2017","1.0 star rating","2JdJdy6c13e_GMLapCE9Mg","Enrico B."

"It shouldn't take 20 minutes for 2 carry out, mediocre tacos...  I think they need to get the kinks worked out to try to speed the production up so that the wait is not so long.  Again these are tacos...   There was over 10 staff members in the kitchen so the wait baffles me..  The staff also very young and attitudinal, no customer service or people skills.  A better location for this place would have been wicker park.  Overpriced as well, I don't care if your in the Gold Coast, tacos should not be this expensive especially for the wait and the pretentious service!  These millennial operators need some better social skills..","3/7/2015","2.0 star rating","DkT4xIZlnNwyGcpgU7vD7g","Charles B."
"What's up with people from the Midwest making tacos with flour tortillas? That shit is whack. As any Mexican knows you GOTTA make a Taco with a corn tortilla. Anyways, I'm giving this place 3 stars since the actual ingredients within the taco were quite delicious and filling. The sauces they had on the side were flavorful, too. Worth a visit if you're hungry and happen to be in the area. Being from Southern California I'm a bit of a taco snob, but there are a few other spots that have definitely delivered. Namely Más, Metro Taco, & Carintas Uruapan. Get your taco on!","4/29/2017","3.0 star rating","pzhJRz4Ay5IcfwYh4EKkvg","Roberto R."
"two small tacos one form the cheaper menu and rung up for a total of 10.50 with just water to drink. yowsa. theres just a tiny more filler in there than last time but my second taco the brisket just fell apart on first bite. the soft tortilla had zero change of staying together sigh. so as usual th sauce on tables is great but I left hungrrrrrry. for 10.50 uh no. good taste tho so 2.5ps there is still a tip jar at the register as you order and pay.

"Delicious tacos, not to mention inexpensive. They combine interesting flavors in unexpected ways... definitely not your traditional taco joint. Of course, that means that you'll come upon some flavor combinations that you aren't as crazy about, but that's part of the fun of it! My favorite are the Poke Ahi Tuna tacos. I can see why Velvet Taco is such a huge hit!Fun location too. Close to a lot of expensive and swanky steakhouses and seafood places, making this place perfect if you're in that area, but don't feel like anything too heavy or expensive.","8/10/2016","4.0 star rating","T8aMDqtKkeDuKKusebuzZg","Eric L."

"First I 'd the Crispy Tikka Chicken Taco which was the hottest taco. It contained hot pepper sauce, butter cilantro, basmati rice, raita cream, thai basil, along with a flour tortilla. It ended up being a taco with an indian flavor. Subsequently as a side I 'd the Crispy tots and local egg which contained herbed goat cheese, smoked cheddar, avocado cream and bacon not to mention the upped eggs on top. Subsequently there only dessert was the trademark Red Velvet Cake which contained the house made icing that was excellent. Subsequently I 'd there house made Frozen Margarita that was excellent.","4/22/2016","4.0 star rating","o7XuMaq2HqeWEcjlreQEcg","Mildred S."
"I've been wanting to try this place, because I always heard from my co-workers how good this place is, their food and their service.I tried their Buffalo Chicken (Crisp tenders, house buffalo sauce, Danish bleu cheese, ranch crema, carrots, micro celery, and flour tortilla) ONLY FOR $4.25.

"I stumbled upon this place in the middle of the day for lunch.  I came mostly because of the fun name, but ended up having an experience that spawned my interest to write reviews.  Very eclectic but relaxed vibe, and I was in and out of there in 30 minutes, spent under 10 dollars, and left with a full belly in an uplifted mood.  Customer service was good--there's only so much interaction you can have with a cashier, but they were friendly and the bussers were quick and efficient.  I enjoyed my rotisserie chicken taco and annatto shredded pork taco by the window, listening to some indie/alternative and a 90's throwback playlist. It was just the pleasant break in my day that I needed. The rotisserie chicken taco was definitely better than the pork.  The roast corn pico was delicious, and I just love rotisserie chicken. The pork taco was too bland and I was disappointed that the avocado cream didn't add much flavor, and was surprised the pineapple didn't give it more of a kick.  Overall, I'd come back for lunch any day, and would like to try it at nighttime too. What a gem of a find!","4/13/2016","4.0 star rating","f5ujxnkBeO6p42PbVjofnA","Megan C."

"Velvet Taco is incredible. First, don't think Mexican and imagine 'what' could be inside a tasty taco. Second, review the menu with delight and order your favorite food (seafood, chicken, etc...) and cuisine (Thai, Cajun, etc... inspired). Third, take a seat upstairs and enjoy the atmosphere until your order is ready. Last but not least, enjoy eating some of the best tacos on Earth. NOTE: 2 tacos is adequate, 3 tacos if you are extremely hungry, especially if you order very different tacos. NOTE: A margarita is an option. As well as Velvet cake.","2/21/2017","5.0 star rating","KKg7SQG-Arxy0-i8MfQF7A","Thomas C."

"Is there anything better than tacos ? I dont think so. This place was an awesome find when I was roaming around late at night. It was totally full at midnight and I had to wait a few mins for a table but it was worth the wait. There are tons of creative totally non traditional tacos that I would have never expected to be delicious - a chick pea / chana masala (i think) taco that was out of this world. As a vegetarian there are not often good taco options and I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a few for me here. I am going to use writing a better review as an excuse to go back...

"The best ""Americanized"" tacos in chicago.The kobe burger is the best thing on the menu. It's even better on a lettuce wrap. Another great taco is the annatto pork. Whoever does the avocado crema sauce is killing it on how good it is. Also, don't skip the elote. The cooks do an awesome job at getting the tacos out fast even when the line is out the door.

Their table taco sauce is really good, I'd buy it by the bottle.I had a Cuban Pig and a fish n chips taco. Both were fresh and very good. The Cuban had pulled pork, bacon bits pickles and a delectable sauce. The fish had an ample size piece of fried cod, a cabbage mix and an interesting mustard sauce.Great place, worthy of a stop when you feel like a good taco and something different.","7/9/2016","5.0 star rating","smg4mElUvkFszfWHcUQ84w","Doug N."

"I am from out of town and a friend recommended this while I was in town, and I am so glad I checked it out! All of the food and service was wonderful. I ordered the picnic chicken taco, and amaretto pulled pork taco. Both were beautiful flavor combinations and was very pleased. I had a piece of red velvet cake to top it off and that was perfect as well. Overall, highly recommend!","3/7/2016","5.0 star rating","f_uXNYwnMPfa0mKel7nJaA","Brooklyn S."

"Looking for authentic tacos, your at the wrong spot. This place offers a variety of unique taco selections, and the tots? Probably the most scrumptious thing I've ever tasted; there's a fried egg on top!!! Small location, however there is a larger seating area upstairs with a decent view of Sate/Rush street. General Manager, Sal welcomed me (a first timer) like I was a regular who dines for every meal. Reality is, if I could give this place 10 stars, I would!","2/23/2016","5.0 star rating","_udYiVlZsXvSHoD98Lda8w","Amy A."

"Awesome joint. Come here all the time and everything I've eaten has been fantastic. Food is spicy for the mild eater so beware. The margs are fantastic and knock you out halfway through. Service can be a little slow when they are busy but it's probably just because they are a super small place. Extra seating upstairs. Highly recommend.","9/7/2015","5.0 star rating","ofYTfLLuRxMh3BPwLJdNPQ","Joe A."

"there is such place as heaven on earth. that place is the velvet taco. I was so inspired by the amazing food that I got a yelp account to review the amazing food! when you first walk in the restaurant gives off a great vibe and is extremely clean. after ordering you are given a number to pick up your food. it is a very short wait even thought it was very busy. it looks small on this outside but is actually pretty well sized. the employees are all so happy and super friendly and helpful and obviously love their jobs. the food was hands down the best I have ever had. we walked a few blocks to eat in our hotel room and it was still steaming hot. we tried all of the chicken tacos which all were extremely delectable. my personal favorite was the buffalo chicken which has a strong kick to it. the signature velvet cake served with caramel sauce is so amazing and even my mom who strongly dislikes red velvet cake is in love. also they have a super cool soda machine with super unique drinks and the water bottles are so cute and very tumblr. velvet taco is amazing! overall amazing service, quick, and the best food ever!!!","7/9/2015","5.0 star rating","-iEF7zJA81Y6xE8wAHz9WA","Sydney G."

"These are not your standard taco shop chicken/carne/veggie tacos. Their non-traditional options are pretty much all delicious. Ingredients taste super fresh. Clearly, I'm a fan. And I was a fan of the Dallas location, so I am legitimately stoked that the Velvet Taco decided to make the move to Chicago just a year after I did.","2/28/2015","5.0 star rating","80ewWDQkTsiB6tTOqZeH2Q","Nell T."
