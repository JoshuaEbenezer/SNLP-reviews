"Came here on a Friday night and was left with nothing but great food and great service. I had planned an engagement dinner for a friend and they were able to accommodate 9 people comfortably and the server John was exceptional. He was very attentive and made suggestions on the menu which all came out amazing. Food wise: The Thai curry wings were amazing with a fine peanut butter spread to top it off. The prime rib was very juicy and full of flavor.All in all awesome place to grab a bite with friends or just come for a quick lunch. If you can recommend a server definitely ask for John.

"Disappointed with this place. I saw it on here and thought the pictures looked great. It's name is perfect. You go in the little side door to the prime rib place attached. It has all the hallmarks of a great place in the beginning. Low ceiling, darkish lighting, small bar area with lots of wood. Sets up for a nice atmosphere. I just couldn't bring myself to order anything in particular from the menu. I tried the avocado mash with pita chips which was basically guacamole with a pretentious name. I love a good bourbon and they had a good selection but you couldn't get a good glass on the rocks for less than 14. It was definitely overpriced. 500 yard away I can get the same bourbon, still have great food and atmosphere for a much better price. I thought about giving it the benefit of the doubt but at $19 for a main when there isn't anything you really like the look of, hard to justify. Two stars for atmosphere but you lose the rest of them with the prices.","3/31/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=d5mW5pBRvnl8uCDgpKC8Sw","Mike T."
"Side door is literally a side door into the Lawry's bar and lounge/ causal dining room. They have their own host to seat you and wait staff ready to serve you. It's totally causal, the wait staff are dressed in t-shirt and causal pants to show the difference between them and Lawry's restaurant. A causal side to Lawry's with a moderate price point for the ones wanting a little bit of Lawry's without having get prime rib.We had a great time chillin at Side door and celebrating a good friend's birthday. We ordered drinks and some burgers. I had the "" side door cheese burger"" and my husband had their prime rib burger that comes with some house made chips. We also order side of white truffle fries it was really good. I love shoe","4/23/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BAo6ZQsIk9tpHn_Qi260DQ","Jaci Y."

"Nice little casual spot in the heart of River North. It's a little pricey yea but it's the area. I tried some of the steak which was really good, and then 2 cocktails and a beer that I liked. They had a good craft beer list, had one that I hadn't had before. And the cocktails I had tasted good and weren't too strong. It's attached to Lawry's if I am not mistaken.","4/4/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z6q3atk8AMY5mzuoHg8tGw","Daniel S."
"Overall good food but our abrasive waiter ruined the experience for us. Probably won't be back anytime soon. Kind of a bummer I'm rating it so low, as previous visits in the past were definitely four star worthy. Anyways, Sidedoor is a classy feeling gastropub serving up premium meats from Lawry's and an awesome selection of really limited beers on taps. For food this last visit, we started with Lobster Bruschetta ~ tomatoes, garlic oil, grilled Ciabatta, I did the Rib House Sandwich ~ caramelized onions, tarragon aioli, and for the fiancée the Fork and Knife Pastrami Sandwich ~ house made pastrami, rarebit, house made giardiniera, pretzel roll. The food was great and flavors were excellent. Service... It all started when our waiter took our order. My fiancée was simply asking if it was possible to sub out the side of chips for a side salad or something else, but was met with a very rude ""EVERYTHING IS A LA CARTE"" as an answer. Umm, okay cool dude. He never bothered to check up on us, and what really rubbed me the wrong way was when he asked the table next to us if they cared for a dessert menu then came by our table and tossed us the bill as we barely finished up. Rude.'Til next time.","11/25/2016","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lZx_XOuL5wACxaNtby4JEA","Francis R."
"I don't know what I did to evoke such a rude demeanor from the blond waiter working this past Saturday night, but man oh man was I taken back by his attitude!My fiance and I dropped in around 7pm on Saturday night. Sidedoor was busy. No surprise given the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival going on.We sat down and the waiter came by and took our order. I was in the process of ordering a sandwich when I thought to ask the guy ""is there anything I can sub out for the side? It comes with chips, right?"" To which he answered ""Yeah. Chips."" So I asked him, ""is there anything I can sub out on the side, like a side salad or something?"" He scowled. ""You could order a salad. Everything here is a la carte."" ..seriously? I've been to restaurants where they haven't allowed substitutions and really, it's not a big deal. But this guy was just snarky. I brushed it off.We had sat down around the same time as another couple next to us, with the same waiter waiting on that table. I hear him fawning over them ""Oh, do you want a dessert? We make our key lime pie in house! It's soooo good!!"" We were just finishing up our entrees, and was expecting him to at least offer a dessert menu, but nope - as he was fawning over the table next to us, he doesn't even make eye contact, and throws a bill on our table - doesn't say a word and walks away.It was so bizarre and odd.","11/21/2016Updatedreview","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=onY0SO_5Zl0IjO6R4-SVrQ","Jean L."

"Great experience at Side Door! We were anticipating coming in with a larger group of 8. We called in advance, and they noted that they do not take reservations but that there was a minimal wait. When we arrived 30 minutes later, they had a table prepared for us! We started with drinks, and there was a decent and unique beer selection. A few of the group ordered the carving boards. The portions were small and came with a few toppings that did not substantiate being called sides. They all noted that the boards were delicious and would order them again. I had the wedge salad and corn chowder, both of which were delicious. Both the lobster mac 'n cheese and shepherd's pie were devoured by those who ordered them. The only miss of the night was the ribs, which my mom thought were chewy and fatty. Overall would highly recommend!","3/25/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NRJ-VuMXvrlY15MkqhZ6Vg","Alex B."
"I grew up in Los Angeles in the 1960s, so I have fond memories of the original Lawry's and CC Browns Ice Cream Parlor. But I'm rarely in the mood for a complete prime rib dinner, so I was interested in trying the Side Door, since it is essentially the bar for Lawry's Chicago.Side Door bills themselves as a gastropub, but to me that implies more eclectic and gourmet food than you'll find here. This is basically bar food, with an emphasis on hamburgers, sandwiches, and some large salads.Of course, the most popular item--and the one I tried--is the prime rib sandwich. It was served on the kind of roll you'd get with a French Dip, and with the same au jus, so it was essentially a Prime Rib French Dip, and a good one at that. The prime rib was perfectly medium rare, very tender, and expertly trimmed.Since the sandwich contains 7 ounces of prime rib it seems a far better deal than their meat plates, which cost the same but contain a mere 4 ounces of meat.I also tried the curried cauliflower which was good, if a bit dry.There's a substantial selection of beers with an emphasis on stouts--a list after my own heart!The space is divided into two rooms, one a bit too brightly lit, where the meat is prepared, and the other with the typical bar TVs.Service was extremely gracious and attentive.","6/7/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA","Steve A."

"I would come back to this gorgeous space for cocktails, but probably not food. Three of us went out for cocktails and small bites. The food and cocktail menus change ever few weeks, so don't bother looking online beyond to get a feel for what they offer. Drinks wise, I went for an apple brandy concoction called The Big Apple and it was delicious. On the food front we ordered scalloped potatoes, Stilton Mac and Cheese, sticky toffee pudding and the ice cream sundae. None of it stood out, although the sundae was probably the best of the bunch. At these prices, I want more than mediocre food (potatoes were nearly flavorless, as was the mac if you didn't get the crumbles on top). Our waiter was a charming dude named J.P. who got a pretty good sense of our ordering rhythm after taking a bit long for one of our drinks. It was nearly empty on the weekday we went, and I would be willing to try the cocktails again if I needed a place to bring a larger group.","10/20/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=39ob3TUuT8AVi4Y_POIJnQ","Hannah C."
"This review is for a quick lunch- a very lovely quick lunch, indeed. I came to SideDoor for a meeting last week and was welcomed by a friendly server, seating me at a levitated table past the bar. This GORGEOUS space (same restaurant family as Lawry's, housed in the historic McCormick mansion along Michigan Avenue) has an ambiance for a comfortable yet classy lunch, with a straightforward menu featuring many enticing eats.I enjoyed the prime rib chili (amazing) and the most beautiful wedge salad I have ever seen. It was the perfect amount, and I even saved a bit of my salad for later in the afternoon.I hope to head to Lawry's soon for the famous table side prime rib dinner!","9/27/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Q_8qAEFkzrzTVAJhLsxmBg","Kristin F."

"We had dinner  tonight at Side Door. I was pleased with our service. Sadly there was one waiter for the entire dining room. Granted it's not a big place, but another person would have been helpful.  Our waiter did the best he could under the circumstances. He even kept refilling our water long after the bill was paid.  That was the good part of our visit. The bad was the food. I had corn chowder.  It was barely warm. My entree was a pastrami sandwich. It was also cool and really greasy. I have never eaten at Lawrys and assumed this food was comparable. I was wrong. The other folks at my table weren't overly impressed with their food either. There are too many good places in the area for dinner. Sadly this is not one I will return to in the future.","1/17/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SIQt7VG22-d3dMMKXy3gjw","Suzanne C."
"Decent place, but probably won't be back.Food was good, but not worth the price. The meat plate (lamb, filet, prime rib) was tasty, but the meat was overly salty (I love flavor, but when served with multiple sauce/toppings the meat shouldn't be overly salted). The lobster mac & cheese was tasty but liquidy.  Service was very average, had to look around and ask other staff for orders multiple times.  I'm not sad we ate there, but have had better meals for half the price.","12/8/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9eBvL5AiuDIu3jCyBwccQA","Anjum K."
"When a visit to the purple pig was thwarted  because of being closed for redecorating we ended up here.Nice cozy gentlemen club atmosphere...think high back chairs and lots of suits.  We tried a couple local beers and decided on the housemade corned beef sandwich with a yummy rarebit  and grainy mustard on a pretzel roll. Very tasty.We also got the poutine with chorizo gravy. Talk about a seriously good lunch.Prices were pretty fair for the area. Our server turned out to be a friend of our mayor back home in st.

"We wanted to do steak at least once in chicago, but this presents a problem since I'm not of the meat eating variety of people. Side door seemed like a good compromise, steakhouse, yet still had some veggie options. Not to mention, multiple friends had recommended it. We had just spent them day walking around downtown chicago, so I guess we might have been a tad underdressed, but the staff didn't blink and led us to a table in the corner with two armchairs. Super comfy seating if I may say so. Granted, those seemed to be the only two arm chairs in the room, but whatever. Our server came over and explained the meat cutting board. After careful deliberation by my fiance, he decided on just the prime rib, I got the mac and cheese and the deviled eggs, and our server was super nice to make sure I could eat it. The eggs were really good. mac and cheese was really good too. But sorry sidedoor, we had Fork's mac and cheese the other day, and I was spoiled by that. My fiance, who had been a little apprehensive about his steak when it was set down in front of him, said it was the most amazing piece of meat. His steak came with friends and horseradish. I preferred the spicy horseradish to the mild one, but hey, different strokes. We thought about dessert, and then we just way too full to even consider it. Loved the decor, loved the pillar in the bathroom, loved the key motif.","6/19/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xVZJVaLBpMN2HeTnZZ_V4w","Tova B."

"Came in on a Monday for lunch.  We were sat in the front portion of the restaurant which only had four occupied tables who were finishing up their meals.  After seeing many great reviews I was looking forward to trying this place out.  For our entrees we ordered the pastrami sandwich and shepherd's pie.  The sandwhich came out about 12 minutes prior to the shepherd's pie and that after it sat under the heat lamp for a good five minutes. The bottom bun was soaked in grease.  I had to clean my hands after every bite I took.  The best part about the entree was the coleslaw.  They had a different spin on it than what I am accustomed to.  It was creamy yet tangy at the same time.  I could've had that as a meal all by itself.  The shepherd's pie was good, but not sure if I'd order it again.  Overall the service was mediocre and food below par.  With the restaurant being as slow as it was, I don't know why the cook fell behind on the order.  I am also wondering if they were short staffed that day too, as there were multiple tables that were left uncleaned.  It wasn't till almost the time that we left that they were cleared of the remnants from the previous patrons.","12/7/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nBP8c1BHo7wK_IcEU3ZKmA","Dusten F."
"I will preface this review with the fact that we caught them on a bad day. Despite that, I have to review based on my experience and, unfortunately, it was a bad one. Typically, I would start with the pros, but because there were so few of them, I will begin with the cons.CONS-Limited Seating. We arrived a little bit before 1pm on Saturday with 11 people. It was clear that they did not have the space for us, but they moved some round barter tables together in an area outside of the dining room to accommodate. It was awkward, but I guess it worked.-Long wait time for food. A few people straggled in late, but we did not wait for them to order. So then, how is it that the latecomers were served before us? All of our food came out a different times, so different, that I had to eat my meal before it got cold and I was done with my meal before my fiancé was even served. -Incorrect orders. If the wait time wasn't bad enough, when they finally started bringing out food, the wrong items were coming out. We had to send back at least 5 things. A few people got the right thing, but prepared wrong, but we had waited so long for the food, it wasn't worth complaining to send it back just to wait another hour for their food.-Where is my water??? It was bad enough I had to ask, it was worse that I had to ask for a water refill on the same empty glass four times. -Where is my waiter??? We had 11 people at our table and we barely saw our waiter. We had more visits by more waiters and a manager by the end of our visit.-Bagged salad. Need I say more?PROS-Had my food come out on time, my burger would have been really good. Unfortunately, it was cold so I didn't enjoy it to the fullest.-Because of our bad experience, they comped our meal and 2 rounds of drinks. However, they made us pay for our first round of drinks...at that point, why would you make us pay for anything??BOTTOM LINEI'll never know if this dining experience was a fluke or the norm, because I'm never going back.","11/22/2015","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ILk5Y4wPNW-7y0_As-xI6A","Regina S."

Lobster Mac was the best I have had with decent chunks of lobster and the perfect baked crunch on top.  Potato chips were some of the best ever as well, coleslaw was not my thing but colleagues enjoyed it.  Overall this was an excellent lunch and I'd recommend lunch or dinner here at Side Door.  Enjoy.","2/15/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hfYkTofQcb1VEiZLK7VFKA","Brian H."
"This is a very nice alternative to the expensive and crowded Lawry's steak house next door.  The Side Door is part of the Lawry's chain but is indeed a separate restaurant, although connected to the steak house through the Side Door's bar area.  The bar itself is warm, welcoming, and snug, with a nice selection of beers and cocktails.  The meats (i.e. prime rib and others) served at Side Door are from the adjacent Lawry's and carved in the Side Door's prep area.  I lunched on an excellent prime rib sandwich au jus with home-made chips. Tender juicy slices, medium-rare, a real treat.  I also had an appetizer of sauteed peppers in a vinegar sauce, which wasn't too spicy, and a nice accompaniment to the prime rib.  On another visit for dinner, I had a slab of prime rib (they can give you the classic prime rib steak instead of in a sandwich upon request) which was equally satisfying; in addition, their sides of haricots verts and roasted cauliflower were also very good renditions.  We shared appetizers of their calamari, pretzel bites (cloud soft inside!), and lobster bruschetta (very very good; i want more please) which were all well executed.  All in all, a great option and experience when you want a more informal meal and good eats!","11/11/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UZ8_xqhiguIYb9Lu2Wu8og","Ken C."

This was for beers, waiting for order, etc.You'll see this same theme on most other reviews I've now noticed. That's why Yelp is great.

"Based on service, no food- because that's potentially what we should have had- I wish I had 4 hands to give them 4 thumbs down. We (3 women and 1 man well dressed for the night) walk in- no hostess at Sidedoor- walk over to Lawry's side- bump into a young man who mentioned he is supposed to seat us. Okay- no problem.We get seated. Water gets poured right away- awesome. Waitress asks if we had been here before- we havent- gives us the menu run down. Perfect.10 minutes passed- we watch her serve 3 other parties of 2 - avoiding our tables frantically. We see her venting to the chefs in the back about to what seems to be about kitchen? It is 8:45pm when they close 10. We wanted to place our order as soon as possible. 15 minutes pass- nothing. We decide to Yelp other places- Beacon Tavern looked promising (we decided on Howells and Hood- find my review on their page). We decide to leave- we look at the back of the room-4 men in a huddle- one which was the hostess. My man friend kindly asks if their kitchen is closing- the hostess says ""we're not closed, we're just not busy"" perfect answer for such lacking service.Skip the mess and go somewhere that makes you feel welcomed, happy, and confident in giving your hard earned business.Wish we had a chance to try the food.

"Got their chicken sandwich that was very tender and seasoned well. My dad got the burger that he also enjoyed, nothing special though. Get the side of fries, they are sooooo good and huge! If you like them heavily salted and skinny. The decor on the inside was very warm and well spread out with two levels. You can look down at the old fashioned bar, with overall great low lighting and a amazing fire place. Didn't get any drinks but they looked delicious.

"I should have left this review right after I ate there (this was WEEKS ago), because I'm not sure I'll do it justice now! It was literally the best burger I've ever had, hands down. This deliciously juicy, perfectly (medium-rare) cooked, wonder of a burger was placed in front of me. I'd asked for avocado to be added and it was perfectly ripe and creamy. Now, you must be made aware that I am NOT a pickle fan. I've never taken to pickles in burgers or out. I had read in the description that there were pickles on this burger and made a mental note to ask for no pickles (as per usual). Apparently my hungry mind over-ran my mouth and decided to forget to ask for this small modification. But boy am I glad I forgot! When the burger arrived, pickles were gone from my mind, I had completely forgotten that they were in the burger. I bit into it and discovered how truly awesome this burger was....it was delectable! I got through half the burger in no time. I thought, wow, I can taste all the flavors and textures so effortlessly. From the soft pretzel bun to the juicy meat and creamy cheese, I was loving it ALL. Well, on my way through the second half, I realize with a small gasp of shock that I had eaten and ENJOYED pickles! These house-made, tasty, crispy pieces were tasty to me. That's what made me realize this was the perfect burger. They made me love (their) pickles. Can't wait to dine here again!","9/22/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u38gQswtSpRf7MctMTdJyQ","Karen B."

It has 4 fist-sized lettuce halves loaded with bacon and cheese to be comfortably shared among 4 people. For the meats the carver's trio is a great deal and we just ordered two to try every meat they had on the menu. The hanger steak is my favorite and whatever they marinate that stuff in is simply amazing! The prime ribs were so soft they melted in my mouth... Do check your bill tho. We caught two errors in ours and apparently they just switched to a new system and glitches like this happen often.

"Side Door is a fine gastro-pub but I really wasn't blown away.  Atmosphere is classy and the service was pleasant, but i just didn't think the food was great.  I had the Chicago Beef, which was the server's recommendation.  It was fine -- a little bland and nondescript. My friend had the prime rib, which was good but not great.  Saving the place is its beer menu, which is filled with exotic and well thought out choices.

"I had been to side door before and had an okay experience. Decided to go back for a late night bite to eat and it was very unsatisfying. We both had the burger as there were not many options. They were out of half of the small bite options. Half way through my burger I found a balled up piece of plastic wrap hanging out of my burger. When I told the waiter he asked if I wanted another and I was so disgusted I did not and told him to take it off the bill.  I was very disappointed that nothing was done to address this issue especially at a restaurant like Lawry's.  No manager came over to apologize.  I will never go back to Sidedoor.  It is a sad excuse to be associated with a top restaurant.","3/26/2017","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rbiMHBk8j8ojGY54I8zl0g","Daniella G."

"Had dinner in lounge area. The few tables in the booth area is quite nice and comfortable. You can watch tv or eavesdrop on conversations at the bar. It's casual here, but if you like to dress up, go ahead. Anyway, their beer draught menu lists beer from light to dark with probably 4 IL brews and rest from California to Maine. Bottle list is a bit longer with more options for cider, sours and IIPAs. You can do flights of 4 for $16.The menu is simple yet delicious. There's definitely ""bar"" food like fish&chips, lettuce wraps, and wings, but if your appetite wants something more ""elegant"", go for the roasted meat boards. I'd recommend the braised pork belly - its crispy outer edges surrounding melt-in-your-mouth fatty layers and moist meat covered in a sauce that's full of umami goodness!!! I'm drooling just thinking about it even though I just had it like 5 min ago! I had the Lawry's wedge and it was good too. 5 mini wedges with chopped egg whites, crumbled blue cheese and beef bacon. I haven't tried dessert, but I did save my last sample of a beer flight for last: ""Not your father's root beer"", ABV 10.7! And they can make this into a root beer float!If you want some quietness, come around 5-6, but it'll start to pickup around 7.

Mine was very good.  We also got some chili and a plate of Mac and cheese which were both very good.  None of the food here comes with a side, so be warned.  Also, the place is a bit expensive.  Sandwiches from $14-19, entrees start around 16 and go into the 30s or higher.  The share the kitchen with Lawry's so that's probably why.  Also, their cheapest beer was $8 or $9.  If not for the prices, I'd give it 5 stars.","12/7/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DLE1NmAmc9Yt2QqBK48Tfg","Mark A."

That being said the service was excellent, the food was excellent,  and they were even happy to accommodate a modification to the Sea Bass to substitute the olive oil for the dairy (dairy allergy). The chef came out personally to make sure it came out well, as it was the first time he prepared it that way. The lamb chops were super as well. Bar cocktails were average,  but nothing that made us want to order another round.

"My review of Side Door - business traveler dining alone during early dinner hours.The good: Ambiance is great. Beautifully, elegantly decorated. Mood lighting, music. All great. The ok: Food. I tried the deviled eggs, wedge salad, and pork poutine. Eggs were good, nothing wrong just not the best I've had. Same with the salad. A unique flavored wedge, not typical of other wedges. But good. Poutine had a unique flavor. I'd pass on those the next time. The UGLY: Servers and staff are awful!!! I was here early dinner (5pm) and was nearly alone in the restaurant. Listened to two bartenders talk loudly with one another about people they have slept with. Then, another staff member joined them complaining about a customer from earlier in the day. Saying ""it doesn't matter, I have two other job offers on the table"". My server attempted to be friendly, but was awkward and slow at best. I am not a picky customer - but hearing about sex, bad customers and receiving slow service (when not busy) don't come close to meeting my needs.

"The concept of this restaurant is great, tasty all American food with some flair (in the back of a nice steak house) at prices that don't carry the responsibility of the pomp and circumstance in the main dining room. For everything that the food was (it was seriously pretty good), the service was the opposite. I don't mind that all of the dishes came out at different times because that fits with the concept but after 45 minutes of everyone else having eaten my wife's entree had still not come out, to the waiters apology he admitted he forgot it. While taking orders he tried to be impressive and not write anything down... And clearly it wasn't a winning strategy. To make matters worse when he went to fill a glass of water, he shattered another glass and little shards went everywhere. He didn't even offer to replace the desert or other drinks on that side of the table which could have had glass in them. This ended our eating and drinking portion of the meal prematurely. The icing on the cake was when we heard an employee at the bar saying to a co worker very loudly-- ""man I only got $100 in tips tonight, this sucks""..... Overall a pretty good restaurant that needs some serious staff training.","1/24/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bjL0eOl38VoMDmXVgErPTg","Matt M."

We saw a guy that happened to walk behind the bar and he told us he could get someone for us.We got an awesome server that continued to make jokes and was really interactive and helpful with the menu...pretty cool actually. I went with the $5 burger which was an angus beef patty with iceberg lettuce, pickled red onion and gruyère cheese (my choice of cheese). I enjoyed the burger very much and would buy it again for its regular price.

Again, perfect. Flavor, texture and portions were all great. One star reduction was because it took 6 minutes sitting at the bar before I was acknowledged which was frustrating, especially on a relatively slow night.

Came here after watching a movie at the AMC Lowes 600 (just a block away) and was looking for a place to eat nearby and boy are we glad we found this place! Hubby ordered the 'Prime Rib Sandwich' and it was delectable. The thinly sliced meat just melted in your mouth, but the star of the dish was the small dish of au jus that came with it. All I was thinking was how many other dishes you could make with this small bowl of liquid. Can I have a bowl of au jus to go please?Based on the recommendation of the waiter, I ordered the 'Fork & Knife Pastrimi' and yes, you do need a fork and knife to eat it as it was messy. The pastrami is 3-weeks work of TLC and well extremely well done. At first glance, it was a big sandwich that I thought I was only able to eat 1/2 of it, but eat bit was a new savory discovery that kept my mouth wanting for more. Needless to say, I ate the whole thing!!!  It's been almost a month since my discovery of this place and I've thought about it constantly. The decor has a warm and cozy hunting lodge feel. Since they close at 10:30pm on Saturday, you don't have to deal with the loud and crazy crowd at a bar waiting for a table. We got here at 8:30pm and was seated right away. I'm a HUGE fan!","5/19/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ukf_t7zLsXL4qqwhVEMx5w","Patty S."

"I've been to Side Door 3 times (drinks and appetizers with coworkers, dessert with my friends and on a blind date) and each time I've enjoyed my experience here. First off, Side Door is a 3 minute walk from my condo so by default I already liked this place. Secondly, each time I've been here I've had great service from the friendly staff working here. Thirdly, the beer menu is impressive, the food is good and the dessert hits the stop.If you love Root Beer like I do, I recommend you try the ""Not Your Father's Root Beer."" This beer tasted just like root beer, which is probably why I downed it in under two minutes and needed a second one.Appetizer -I'd say try the blue cheese potato chips with crispy prosciutto. You get a plate filled with chips covered in this awesome blue cheese sauce. Worth trying and you get enough to share with someone else.Food- Spiced Rubbed Leg of Lamb: the lamb comes sliced and on a board with some different dipping sauces. The lamb was tender and delicious. - House Smoked Pastrami: was pretty darn good. The sandwich comes packed with a nice portion of warm pastrami covered with this hoppy cheddar rarebit on a pretzel bun. I can see why three different waiters/waitresses recommended I try this. I enjoyed every bite of this sandwich.Dessert - Sticky Toffee Pudding: is the one to get! It's so good, but I wish a scoop of vanilla ice cream came on top of it.SideDoor is pretty awesome and I would definitely recommend this place for drinks, dinner, a quick stop for dessert or as a date spot.","4/30/2014","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LNooRhqlM6ebjgm5KT1KLA","Norm J."
"This is a great date spot and really cute. We went here tonight after work and I felt a little under dressed, but the wait staff made us feel right at home.We shared and loved everything. The stuffed shrimp and poutine were delicious! I saved room for dessert and we shared the sticky toffee pudding. Also delicious.I also didn't realize we would be in for a musical treat. They had a jazzy band there that was really good.

"Although the prime rib it was delicious, it was a shaved too thin like roast beef. The menu is limited, and although it was simply for lunch, it was very very expensive. The server was nice and the timing was great, and their chipotle deviled eggs were outstanding. But all in all, it was a little more expensive then what I was expecting.

"To start I'd like to say that the vibe of this place is pretty cool. Dim and quiet, not a lot of chatter like most places. We had a small room off the main area with a booth. The waitress was super friendly and definitely willing to share her knowledge of the everything the Sidedoor had to offer. The beer menu is eclectic to say the least, albeit a bit pricey. The calamari was an amazing starter. The fork and knife pastrami is also a a must try. We had a dessert too, but I can't remember it's name, although it was also great!

"SideDoor was a wonderful meal to close out a fun weekend trip to Chicago. It was fantastic to escape the tourist crowds even though this place is located right next to the bustle of the Magnificent Mile. We went right before noon on a major holiday, and there was plenty of seating immediately available. We were a little bummed that the legendary meat board had been retired from the menu, but we quickly forgot once the delicious food came out.Prime rib poutine: Great. The pickled veggies atop the plentiful meat and gravy added a lovely acidic kick to the all-around solid appetizer.Prime rib sandwich: Great. The bread was crispy, the meat was tender and plentiful, and the au jus and horseradish creme added wonderful flavor.Sticky toffee pudding: Great. This warm, rich cake paired well with the cooling taste of creme anglaise.The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated with copper tones, rich wood, and a tin ceiling. On top of that, service was extremely friendly; everyone was so warm and courteous that I thought I was back in Texas.","5/25/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EwxoyqOGJ458ZUxxKOPKHw","Lisa G."

"I was visiting Chicago last weekend, and yelped for the closest ""Gastropub"" in the area since I am a craft beer guru.  Side Door came up as first choice, so I stopped in and sat at the bar.  I was very impressed with the draft selection, they had a few rare drafts, most of them are from local breweries.  There were several IPAs on tap, and although I don't like hops, I tasted a few and they were pretty good!  I stuck with my favorite, the sour ales.  They had a fabulous sour ale by Two Brothers, ""Fathom.""  It was amazing.  There were several other Two Brothers selections, as well as some from Firestone Walker.  I didn't eat here, but the menu choices were so top notch, I seriously wanted to order one of everything.  The menu changes every week, so that is cool, you can always come back and get something different!  The atmosphere is prim and proper, but trendy and beautifully remodeled.  Grand staircase and high ceilings.  Reminds me of pre-prohibition type pubs.  The bartender was awesome, and all the wait staff were so friendly, they were chatting with me, giving me some history of the place and good tourist things to do while in Chicago.  Overall, 5 stars for Side Door, I hope its stil there next time I go back to Chicago so I can come again!","7/10/2014","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CjJhEzdWQNEKa7grwPRQyg","Stephanie S."
"Excellent. Menu is small & changes, which excites me. We sat in the bar at a small round table, so can't talk about the dining room. The bar was dark, wood, some candles. Service started at a high level, but mysteriously faded as we worked through our food. Our server got injured in the kitchen, or something like that..  got a little weird at the end. Aside from that the food was superb. Except the Avacado Mash, way too heavy on the lime, skip it, maybe try the deviled eggs. Tri-meat board, potatoes, mac n cheese, asparagus, yum. The Prime Rib & the Roger sandwiches big hits. When back in Chicago, hope I can swing back by.","11/10/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Du-_DV5offWUWMzlll5m-A","Chris M."
"Random stop based solely on skimming the reviews and pictures of this place.  What a wonderful surprise!  We had pretzels, with a wonderful honey-forward mustard sauce.  Heavenly. The gf had a wedge salad, best Bleu cheese dressing either of us have ever had, and we're super picky.  I had the fork and knife pastrami, and a side of scalloped potatoes.  Maybe one bite in I was chided for cooing with utter glee at the ample am out of deliciousness placed in front of me...  apparently I was dancing in my seat.  Cocktails were exceptional and our service (weston, I believe?) couldn't have been better.  Knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and made perfect suggestions (I know that technically falls under knowledgeable but it stands to be said individually)  If we weren't out of towners, I would probably have a labeled seat at this bar from frequency.  Bravo","7/9/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xNd-z85UxzMIzNl4vjsnNw","Andrew G."
"This is a great gastropub with a good track record of pleasing its customers. Count me in. The small room off the bar is dark and clubby. I had a nice cocktail called a Blind Pelican made with Buffalo Trace bourbon, Aperol, lemon and rhubard bitters. Tres refreshing. The menu is mostly bites and small plates. I ordered a caesar salad made with red & green kale and white anchovies--yes, real anchovies. Followed by a board of deliciously seasoned and perfectly cooked lamb chops. These are served with little dipping sauces and caramelized onions. I can see how coming here can be quite addictive. Easy on your wallet?--no, but quite enjoyable. And the service is very fine. This is a cool retreat off Michigan Avenue, open for lunch and dinner, so head on over.

"This place really surprised me. I went here on Memorial Day for lunch and they were empty which worked out great because I was starving and not in the mood to wait anywhere. When you go, I recommend ordering their steak nachos. They're one of the best nachos I've ever had. The portion is large and the chips are spread out so every chip has a topping. I also tried their prime rib sandwich which was great as well. I'm curious to go back and see how their dinner is but in the meantime it's definitely a great place to go for lunch.","5/29/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hDmXu5XyQSGSCMrqHet89Q","Jami J."
"5 stars for our dining experience. The bar experience I would give 2 stars. Bar experience:I was standing near the server station all the way at the end of the bar because the bar was packed. My boyfriend and I just wanted to order a drink and get out of the way while waiting for our table. Sean, one of the bartenders, looked at me and in a very condescending way said, ""This is our serving station. You know, where my servers pick up their drinks?"" I know this and would have gladly moved out of the way when a server came up, but seeing as the bar was packed I was just looking for an open area to get a drink and move on. He proceeded to tell me to move to the other server station. Which...makes no sense. So, I go to the other server station and order a drink, which I apparently pronounced wrong, so Mr. Sean had to correct my pronunciation. He really rubbed me the wrong way and I told my boyfriend that if the rest of the experience was like this I would walk out. Dining Experience:Thankfully, our server and dining experience was FANTASTIC. Unfortunately, I cannot remember our servers name, but he was awesome. We were at a table just outside of the little kitchen area so we were able to see everything being made. Loved it! We ordered the pretzels and the baked mac and cheese to start. They were wonderful, the horseradish honey mustard with the pretzels was great! We then got the prime rib sandwich. Prime rib is one of their specialties and it was outstanding! Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Because of him and the dining experience, I would definitely give this place another shot. That shot will avoid the bar though.","12/11/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TF4V8DuNiA9LEEf6IpZhvQ","Melissa P."

"My sister in-law and her boyfriend were in town visiting and we found ourselves downtown without a dinner reservation. I haaaaate being downtown in general because the food tends to be overpriced and mediocre. But, thanks to Yelp, I found this place and we decided to walk over and check it out. We came in at 7pm on a Saturday night and were told it would be just a few minutes. Great! We sat in the bar area while we waited for the rest of our party to join us. The server in the bar area was fabulous and we tried the ""Not Your Father's Root Beer"". Yelpers, please listen: you MUST try it. It's amazing! It's root beer with a 10.7% kick. So good. When the rest of our party arrived we were sat. We had a fabulous booth for our party of six that was separated from the dining room with a tied back curtain. The little alcove made it much easier for us all to hear each other at dinner. Excellent! Our server explained that it's an open kitchen so the food will come out when it's ready so you might not get everything in an order you would prefer. That's fine though, it ensures your food is hot. I ordered the fork and knife pastrami sandwich. I will be dreaming about that sandwich for a long time. It was perfect. I sampled my sister in-law's mac and cheese and it was delicious. The only hiccup in the whole meal was when the server was clearing our plates and noticed that my sister in-law had gotten the pork tenderloin sandwich instead of the prime rib. She hadn't even notice but he gave us a complimentary dessert and adjusted our bill. Amazing service! I would not hesitate to recommend this place and my husband and I might very well make the trip back downtown specifically to go here for a date night.","1/25/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bvGO_TqdIXFo-mNj2SsXhA","Natalie S."
"I had a really great time here last night catching up with some friends. I was a little nervous they didn't take reservations, but at 7pm on a Tuesday we were seated immediately. We had our choices of still, sparkling, or ice water which was new. I thought still was the ""free"" one, but apparently it's ice water (#FoodieonaBudget).Our waitress was nice and gave excellent recommendations and explained the menu to us since we all have never been there before. However she was a little pushy on a salad because it was her ""favorite"" and she was afraid it would be taken off of the menu.The had a musician performing sad acoustic covers (the most depressing drawn out variation of Nirvana's ""Teen Spirit"" I have ever heard), which none of us were really into. I don't know if that's just a Tuesday night thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea.We all ordered the All Hail Kale sandwich and it was delicious. I'm not a huge kale fan but it was in an apple slaw that was awesome. Loved the bread and I ate the whole thing. I would have loved dessert, but I was too full! We also split a side of mac & cheese that was pretty good, but I wasn't into the bacon in it.Only 1 unisex bathroom which I found odd (unless there's another one that I didn't see), but overall I liked the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's definitely downtown prices, but I'd recommend splitting sides (even entrees if you want) with your group. Our waitress was able to split with 3 cards so that worked well.Ps. This is on the corner of Rush & Ontario.

"On a recent trip to Chicago we stayed at the Intercontinental on Michigan Avenue. We had Afternoon Tea at the Langham Hotel (awesome experience) and weren't hungry until later in the evening. We looked for a restaurant that was within walking distance of our hotel.I used Yelp to locate some options. I stumbled across Side Door and looked at the menu. We decided to try it. And boy am I glad we did.It's adjacent to Lawry's Prime Rib. It's like the hipster baby cousin version. We were greeted by a gentleman with a fabulous mustache. It was like walking in to a speakeasy. The dark wood and dim lighting added to the ambience.I would say this is a very masculine restaurant. From the decor to the menu, but I'm okay with that. I just had the girliest afternoon sipping tea and eating scones. I needed some gin and meat to balance my hormones.I had a rosemary and grapefruit gin cocktail. We shared an iceberg lettuce salad. Best darn iceberg lettuce salad ever. I actually tried to recreate it when I got home.Mom had Lake Perch Fish and Chips and I had a Pastrami Sandwich with Spicy Gardinera and Cheddar sauce. It was all delicious. The only down fall was that the waiter took a long time to take our orders, because he was tending to another table.The price was affordable and the food was delicious.

"Wow what an absolute let down.  Great review great looking menu but either I hit an off night or people on Yelp need to drink a lot less before writing their reviews. The decor is very cool and hip.   Some of the staff was on the ball but our server was about the worst I have had in a LONG time and this was one of the worst dining experiences have had in years.  If you look at my other reviews you can see I eat out a lot and am fair with my reviews so take heed. From the top, we walk in about 8 on a Monday night and were seated right away. The server can over told us about the menu, well pushed on us the restaurants desire for us to by their meat board, which individual servings are 1/4lbs.  Now why I say push is that our server have the same speech to everyone seated and not only was the  ""house specialty"" but she recommended that we ""save"" bye either getting three choices for one of us or a 6 pack for the table.  Now let's do the math shall we, 6 orders X .25 lbs = 1.5 lbs meat for two of us, that would be me and my wife oh ya and a couple of sides.   Seriously!? Rule of thumbs says 1/4 to 1/2 meat per person.  Let me digress because there is SOOO much more to cover.  So we finally decide on what we want, for me Knife and fork pastrami burger on a pretzel bun, my wife the cheese burger with American with a side fries and mac N cheese to split.  I also ordered a ""Not your Dad's root beer"".So the drink comes and it is as advertised a root beer flavored drink with alcohol, something new but nothing I would order again.  I finish the drink and set eh glass aside, and wait... and wait... I finish my water and wait.. my wife empties her glass and we wait.... Finally after I put my 2nd empty glass (water and ""beer"") of to the side of the table the waitress gets the hint and fills up my water glass but doesn't offer me another drink or clear the empty one.  Now I know this may sound petty but I would like to think that there is a certain level of service all restaurants should have and drinks and used items should be removed.  I mean 99.9% of all the Chili's and Applebee's would know to clear the used stuff and offer a new drink.The food arrives (note they server you the food as it is done so things can come out of order, but they do tell you this up front) I get my burger and my wife gets hers and a minute or so later we get the sides.  Both look amazing... this is where things stopped going from ok to just flat out BAD.  My pastrami was so greasy I had to stop eating it after two bites, I honestly was worried I would get sick from the amount of grease, it was so bad that after eating a couple of bites my napkin was so greasy I had to take it off my lap for fear or staining my clothes (see picture posted), I shoved my plate off to the side and simple wasn't going to eat it.  My wife's burger was ok, average at best until she got a few bites into it and found that it was under cooked.  Now let me add to this, she asked to make sure ""I want no pink in the patties"", the waitress said medium well which my wife agreed to.  After about 3 - 5 minutes of my food just sitting there the waitress comes by to check on us..mind you she didn't even pick up on the fact my food was pushed off to the side with only a few bites taken.  She didn't even ask about it I told her to just take it away I couldn't eat it.  At this point I would have expected the standard question ""Is there something else from the menu I can get you"" but I was offered nothing.  We also asked for some ketchup for the fries then too.  Again 3-4 minutes later we flagged down the waitress and asked about the ketchup she had forgotten and then offered me something else in place of my other burger.  By this time I was just ready to go so I said no.  My wife pushed her partially uneaten under cooked burger to the side as well and we ate the boring plain overpriced fried and mac and cheese.All said and done they took the two burgers (that we didn't really eat) off the bill, the manger never came over and apologized and the waitress sort of tried but fell flat.  Summary would be nice looking place, expensive drinks (on par with most places like this) clueless staff, gross food or just boring food and a customer service level that rivals with the DMV!","3/17/2015","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0iqXturyn6_RrFkEXxu5bA","Tim V."

Our server went through the menu with us and was very knowledgable. I ended up getting fish and chips and my boyfriend got skirt steak which both were delicious. The fish was perfectly battered and you didn't have to worry about the batter falling off or being saggy and the fries were perfect and crisp. The skirt steak was so flavorful and came with an array of dips, horseradish, hot peppers etc. we also got the Brussels sprouts as an app which was an excellent choice.

Not only had neither of us been there but we planned on a movie post feasting and AMC was just a block from the restaurant. As soon as we walked in, we were meet with a dimly lit, semi romantic atmosphere. Tables & chairs of various sizes and comfort levels throughout the establishment. The decor reminded me of a haunted house, in a kind of strange good way. There was a giant turtle shell on one wall, huge portraits (a la Haunted Mansion at Disney World) and fancy candelabras. They have a lot on the menu that sounds absolutely delicious! Some soups and small plates were really sounding good to me but in the end I decided to go not so classy and order their grilled cheese for $10. This was a pretty intense grilled cheese! Way better than most places and I would have to bestow it the honor of being my second favorite grilled cheese in the city. It has some seriously funky cheese up in there and just like the haunted house comment, that's funky in the good way. I still have no idea what kinds of cheeses were on the sandwich but I'd venture to say it was a couple and one had some kind of seeds or something in it. It was amazing. The downfall of the sandwich was the grease. My fingers would get soaked in the oil and the napkin it rested on was soaked through. Plus it had a bit too much crispness to the bread. Overall though, I wouldn't hesitate on getting the sandwich again, but would be prepared with some extra napkins to soak the grease up.My dining companion had Lawry's Prime Rib Sandwich and gave me a bit to indulge on. I wasn't that into this sandwich. I found it to be a bit dry and just not overly exciting. Especially for $18. Just seemed a bit much for what it was - a sandwich all on its lonesome with nothing on the side.I liked Side Door, found it to be A-OK and one of the best things about it is that you're right in downtown and can get a seat. Like get a seat immediately on a Saturday night which is almost unheard of! I wouldn't balk at coming here again though I can say with confidence I'm not going to be going out of way to dine here again.","10/20/2014","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QnIrewrXxFnssw_gG1gF-Q","Sarah S."
"PLEASE STOP HERE!!!What a fantastic find SideDoor was. Looking for something in area a little different and they were that and more. Superb customer service from greeting to goodbye from all wait staff. Coupled with wonderful menu offering SideDoor was a great experience. Oh and by the way, the food is outstanding. Pork Belly delivered wonderful flavor and Scallops were done to perfection. My only disappointment was no room left for dessert which looked just as good.","9/14/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BNGiLEL03L4peu_medknAA","Daryl S."
"Had lunch here while visiting Chicago.  The reviews were so great I expected much more.  The service wasn't at all what I would expect from the fact that it is a Lawry's Steakhouse Restaurant and I was seated at a small round 2-top that felt like it belonged in the bar not in the main restaurant.  Not comfortable but again maybe this is just a lunchtime setup and dinner is better.I had the salmon which was perfectly cooked and delicious but the salad was so ridiculous -- it was seemingly a grocery store bagged salad.  Why a place like this would serve a chopped iceberg lettuce salad that is heavily dressed is beyond me when creating a good lunchtime salad takes so little cost or energy.  The iced tea was watered down which again is an easy fix.  So after being here I told my friends who had planned to go to lunch the next day to keep on walking -- so many great places in Chicago to beat this. So, although the salmon was good  all the environment, service and other issues made it a negative experience for me.  I'm guessing dinner with a steak might be a good experience but you'll have to try that yourself.  I'll check back to see what you thought!","9/21/2015","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FGh5WAvwIqKSoRQwn91qLw","E D."
"The food was great. Seriously. Everything was outstanding. 5-stars, no question. The service? Not so much. First: unless I am at a frat party bar in LP, as a server, you are allowed a maximum of 5 ""bro-isms"" per meal, and I think that's being generous. Please do not call me ""dude,"" ""bro,"" ""man"" or anything of the like throughout my entire meal. Second: when I order a draft, I hope to get it within 5 minutes--also generous, I think. I watched my draft sit at the server station nearly 15 minutes before I flagged down another server to get it delivered to me. Third: I had a weird interaction with my bro-server. It went like this. Him: ""Still working here, man?"" Me: ""Nope, we're finished."" Him: ""Cool. So do you want me to clear these plates?"" No, chief, I love just sitting around with my dirty plates... And as if that question weren't awkward enough, he walked away and then took 10 minutes before clearing the plates. So, in sum: great food, awkward and at times abysmal bro-service.","8/10/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qrYM43lA655vJKkDLiHEyQ","Aaron D."

"This and every other review should be a five star but their inability to service the lounge is incomprehensible.  Maybe I'm just that customer that fell through the cracks of service, but for it to happen more than once is inconceivable! (If you don't want to read my review, know that their small plates and cocktails are BADASS! and for that alone it should be rated FIVE stars but, service is weak and terrible.  On a date, I would definitely go elsewhere.  Service is what kills the rating.)My first visit was a month back whilst ""gastropub hopping"" with friends.  This was our second stop on an early Saturday evening and for having only a drink plus shared appetizers, we were WOW'ed.  Our waiter whom resembled ""Sam Smith"", seemed delightful enough initially, but was hardly caring enough to come around to check on additional drink or food orders.  Getting a reload on water was a feat!  Going to the bartender resulted in being rerouted back to the server, whom we learned was assisting the entire lounge! Hire more people, WTF!  (Note: We sat at the comfy couches near the front of the lounge, closest to the bar.  This close proximity gave no added benefit.)  For best drinks, order what is often mentioned in reviews or the special cocktail of the week.  For small plates, the deviled eggs were very good and the Prime rib poutine (Prime Rib Poutine, cheese curds, beef gravy, giardiniera, fries)was ""outta this world.""  Had they been able to come round' for another drink order, we would have ordered a couple of those to go!2nd visit was for a drink date on a week day, just this past Wednesday.  She beat me to the table and was met by the server.  She'd asked for a large water or if they could leave a pitcher on the table so that she could properly hydrate, it was a hot day.  He said he couldn't oblige either request but could return with a refill soon after she finished the first pour.  LIES!  I joined the table, once he poured that first glass of water.  We sat and chatted.  And chatted.  And chatted some more.  (During this time, the both of us were looking around for the server so that we could place a drink order.  But he never came by.  The place was maybe at 40%, with people there for after work drinks and tourism.)  Our patience wore out after twenty-five minutes had passed.  So, I asked if she would join me at Watershed.  I'd been there recently and knew their servers actually visited tables.  She decided to thank the waiter for the water and indicate to him that we were going elsewhere for better service.And all I wanted was a great drink and some fucking great poutine!  I don't care how busy it is, no table should wait longer than ten minutes.  If that first drink order is not received, you better get your heiny back over there and fill an order.  You don't get paid to leave llamas grazing at tables!  As I stated earlier the food and drink is a solid 4 or 5 stars.  It's great.  But the service.. Holy crap.Have additional tips on this business?Good for groups? Hell-fucking no.Good for kids? Have you heard any of the conversations that are happening in here? It's probably wise to leave the wee ones out of here.Has TV? Naw, I dunno.","6/22/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1xJwMqmvVXPwY7yEVQIc-A","Jacob J."
"This place feels like a hidden find, tucked away on the side of a building (literally).  We walked right by it the first time only to realize we must have missed the door, so look out!The bar area is large and welcoming and as you walk into the various lounge / dining areas I felt like I was taking a bit of a step back in time to an older, fancier Chicago.  It was beautifully decorated for the winter holidays when I was there but I'd imagine that it'd be a great space to have a large dinner or a private gathering.The staff was really friendly and we had our pick of tables (granted, it was 4pm on Monday) and were happy to find out that they have 50% of the ""bite"" category on their menu from Mon-Fri from 3-5pm.  I ordered a SideDoor mule and M ordered a Cocoa Old Fashioned.  My mule was a bit strong, but had a nice smooth ginger flavor and was very refreshing.  M's Old Fashioned was awesome - bacon bourbon, which definitely tasted smoky, and had a nice cocoa flavor that lingered in your mouth.  Unique and memorable.We also enjoyed the potato boats, a large baked potato cut in half and then stuffed with meaty chili, bacon, sour cream, cheese and chives, as well as the pretzel bites, which were pillows of pretzel dough with a zippy mustard sauce.  The food came out pretty quickly after we ordered and were piping hot.The waitstaff was really open to us hanging out way past happy hour, clearing our dishes and refilling our water glasses but not pressuring us to hurry up.  I would definitely want to come back for dinner or for another round of drinks!","1/5/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RvwIAsqfuf0e4R4SIAjrJw","Jenn E."

We ended up eating like kings. My wife had the fried brussel sprout salad (yeah, weird huh) and it was probably the best salad I've ever had. Then she put the dressing on and it was even better!I had the fork and knife pastrami which was amazing. No fat on the meat and a soft pretzel bun.

"On the north side, craving red meat after a long day walking around, we stumbled on SideDoor and were NOT disappointed. The menu's not very long, and changes from week to week. This has obvious, immediate benefits. The options are all seasonally appropriate, unique, and interesting, without sounding overly pretentious or complicated. Exhibiting great balance in flavors, everything we had was absolutely delicious. The Prime Rib sandwich was probably the best I've ever had. The Prime Rib is from next door, so it's great, if a little salty, but it's paired with a horseradish that has just the right amount of bite, on a bun that is neither too soft, too hard, too chewy, or too crunchy. Heaven. Add to that, fried pickles, asparagus with capers, goat cheese, and garlic vinaigrette, and skirt steak poutine, and we were stuffed to the gills by the time we waddled out the door. I can't say enough about the service or the atmosphere. On a Saturday night, they were busy, but not loud or crowded feeling. We were seated in two wingback chairs at a table that was just the right size. Our service was great, and we felt it was a great value for what we paid. Interested in going back with a larger group to try it ""tapas style"" so we can taste more of the menu!","8/28/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qIccpERWrdBG-FDS_5SlqA","Chelsea L."
"We came here for burger week, and I felt like service was a bit slow. I think they might have been slightly understaffed. The burger was small and it wasn't very filling.

I can't say that it's done much to persuade me to try out the larger Lawry's Restaurant either.","8/18/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=igaoaFNkX7ieMuyUBg0u5w","Leang E."
"We came on a Saturday at around 7:30. They don't take reservations so the wait was estimated at about an hour for a group of 8 which was similar to everywhere else nearby. They had a lounge for you to sit and they take orders for drinks and appetizers and such which was really nice because the wait time didn't seem that long. The servers were very friendly, accommodating, and very attentive to us. We ordered ahead while in the lounge which caused an issue between switching servers but it was quickly sorted out. We kept our server John who was fantastic.I ordered the Braised Pork Poutine which I thought was alright because there was way too many peppers on it. I would recommend to go light on the peppers because they compliment the dish to an extent. My friends all ordered different things but I had a taste of the skirt steak on the meat board which was only 13 dollars but so juicy and tender definitely worth the money. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in town.","9/12/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=f5bXG-N6mzaNf7SCnng1oA","Sylvia C."

"Stellar sandwich selection at lunch, including The Roger, a fork-friendly pastrami sandwich ($13) with caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese on grilled sourdough. And the Lawry-inspired prime rib sandwich ($19), the size of a small infant, is topped with shaved prime rib, whipped cream horse radish on a large baguette. The restaurant itself is somewhat dark and moody, but far more casual than the main dining restaurant, with most of the signature items being prepared at a chef's station in the back of the room. The hands'down surprise for lunch was our Fried Brussels Sprout Salad ($10), featuring shaved sprouts, slivered carrots, dried cranberries, candied pecans with a sweet chili vinaigrette - simply an amazing selection of flavors and textures that's almost interesting enough to woo you in by itself. Wash it all down with a ""Not Your Father's Root Beer,"" a boozy 10.7% childhood favorite that's a blast from the past.","6/28/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vz4eJpx3VpIoqC0VobaRDA","Jamie M."

"I went here on a slow Wednesday and had the whole bar to myself.  They had a good selection of booze and beer and it was all mine to choose from.I got the pastrami sandwich based upon some pics I saw on here.. It was delish but super sloppy - there's a reason they call it the fork and knife pastrami sandwich but I'm a stubborn Frenchman who had to blaze his own trail.. After going through a few napkins and getting some weird looks from the bartenders, I decided to go the fork/knife route and things cleaned up considerably.  The taste was very good.. Just don't try to pick it up and eat it.I also had the cheese/meat plate where you choose from a bunch of different options - I don't know if I just have a knack for cheese plate decision making or if I got lucky, but mine was fantastic (pic attached).The service was great and very friendly as well.  The overall menu didn't pique my interest quite as much as others I've encountered in Chicago but the service and great taste of what I ordered gets them a 4 (very good!!).","9/8/2014","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o0e5lXGVgUZrseVwVsEIDw","Ben A."
"Our experience at SideDoor may have been an unusual one, but it seemed to merit a review, at least for the establishment to recognize its flaws. My friends and I picked this place to try based off of some of the reviews and the pictures of the restaurant - it seemed cozy and the food sounded good so we gave it a try. We went on a Saturday night at around 6:30, and given that the place doesn't take reservations, we were told that a table would be ready in 20 minutes. It ended up being closer to 30-35 minutes, but not a big deal - we weren't in a rush or anything. However, that's when the poor experience began. The restaurant has normal seating for dining in the back past the bar and there's also a room to the left when you enter. There's an area to the right near the host stand, but it is more suitable and seemed generally used for those coming just for drinks. However, we were sat at a lone table in the corner in this lounging area away from the usual dining area where we had seen the pictures posted online. It took away from the ambience to be separated and surrounded by others that were in the area just for drinks, but again, the ambience thing wasn't a huge deal; they were busy and I suppose they wanted to be able to seat people as soon as possible. However, since this area was not very suitable for dining, our service ended up being terrible.The waiter came by asking for drink orders and when we weren't ready, said he'd give us time and come back. It was about twenty or twenty five minutes before he returned. By that point, we were all ready to order food as well so we got two appetizers, and two entrees alongside our drinks. The appetizers came out first which were pretty good - we got the avocado smash which was similar to guacamole and the pretzel appetizer which was also very good. About five minutes later, my friend got her burger that she had ordered but she had requested no cheese (she can't eat cheese). The waiter left before she could say anything. It was another ten   minutes before my entree (the prime rib) came and was brought by another waiter. We told him that my friend had ordered the burger without cheese and also that we never received our drinks - we were well done with the appetizers by that point. He seemed shocked and apologized profusely and told us the drinks would be on the house (We wished that this second waiter had been our waiter the whole time) and sure enough, the drinks came within 5 minutes. The original waiter came back around and apologized and made excuses about the bar being backed up (which from our own observations, didn't seem that bad). He also didn't seem to realize that my friend was still waiting on her burger. It took another fifteen minutes for her meal to come out and I was done with my meal at that point. Luckily, we don't get really fussy about bad service and we're generally understanding about busy nights and what not, but it was just a uniquely poor experience that should be brought to management's attention. Overall, while service was bad, the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about but a good meal taste-wise.","12/6/2015","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JYof7bIqys3SwDeCFBGfXw","Shirley C."
"Wow.  The Fork and Knife Pastrami is pretty darn special.  Whoever called it ""life changing "" wasn't wrong.   Pretzel bun, a few small chunky veggies, melted cheese, and breathtakingly great meat.  Do it.

Our server was very attentive, and multiple people came over to our cozy table to ask how we were enjoying ourselves. The only negative was the music. It was all Top 40 and was playing very loudly.

"The service at this place is terrible, and I will never be back.I went in expecting this to be the bar of Lawry's.  I have lived in Chicago for a long time, and I'm not sure when it became ""separate,"" but looking through Yelp reviews, it was within the past couple of years.  Right off the bat, there are organizational issues.  Apparently there is a separate door further down on Ontario or Rush.  But if you don't know that, you'll walk into the main entrance of the restaurant, head to the bar area, and grab a table without being seated by a host....as you would at any normal restaurant bar.  The host at Lawry's is up the entry stairs and to the right, so of absolutely no use if you would even think to question whether the bar is self-seating or not.  Nor is there any signage or anyone else to otherwise greet you.  As a result, you'll sit for a long period of time without waters, menus, or a server approaching you, because no one was assigned to your table.  And the server will be confused because Lawry's patrons waiting for a table in the restaurant will just make themselves at home in the the bar tables....again, complete lack of organization.  Strike one.Finally got waters and menus and things seemed to be looking up.  Ordered a glass of wine and some small plates.  It was a weekend night, and I intended on having at least two glasses of wine.  But the server walked by my table approximately ten times with an empty glass sitting right there and never bothered to ask if I wanted another one.  However, she did offer to ""top off"" my water.  I'm not in the business of begging for service, so I didn't have another glass of wine.  Instead, I went to Trader Joe's after the meal, bought a bottle of wine, and took it home.  Strike two.The wait for the check was annoyingly long.  By this time, many tables had cleared out, yet the server seemed capable of doing only one thing at a time.  Bring Table A waters, go back to the bar to get Table B's drinks.  Go back to the kitchen to bring something out.  Ask tables one at a time if they needed anything, including the table right next to mine...without turning around before heading back to the bar or computer or whatever and asking if I needed anything.  I worked as a server for many years during my student days.  It's service 101 that you accomplish as many things as you can during each pass through the dining room.  This server's mantra was complete each request fully before even inquiring as to whether another table had a request or needed anything.  It doesn't work.  Strike three.        Very disappointed that this bar is no longer technically a part of Lawry's, and very disappointed by the organizational issues and lack of service; I expected far better in this establishment and in this part of town.","11/20/2015","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_YuaQC6ICnvQ2R1s48Mz6A","Tara M."
"The food. The sliced steak was wonderfully done. The meat board is a nice luchtime option and it pairs well with the quite loverly pinot meunier served. Things got off to a confusing start as the restaurant opened late for lunch, staff sitting at the Lawry's bar seemed a bit befuddled that I was there and eventually roped me back over to the ""side door"" to eat in the proper room. How the hell was I supposed to know if you don't greet your customers properly?Once inside and seated, the server was a bit edgey and sporatic but I honestly, eventually believe that he was just eager to get everything around the restaurant in order.

"I find trying brand new or new-ish restaurants incredibly titillating. There's something about the freshness of a recently opened establishment that really gets me going. I always like to see what a new restaurant has to offer. I like to check out the interior before there's wear and tear. I love seeing progress over time (if I return). And frankly, I enjoy going to places before others find out (later, there are huge lines, long waits, or impossible-to-get reservations). Side Door is a relatively new place having opened a couple months ago. I read about it and immediately bookmarked it knowing I was returning to Chicago. I also knew I was arriving late on a weeknight and needed a place with a *full* late night menu. Side Door is literally a side door... or, at least the entrance is located on the side. When you walk in, you immediately get the sense that this is one of those joints that feel ""Classic Chicago"" yet you're in the 21st century. When you enter through the second door, you'll notice a lounge with plush seating to the right, an adjacent bar, and straight ahead is the connection to Lawry's (Side Door's sister property). To the left is a well-appointed dining room. Simply, the decor is ""masculine"" in the sense that dark browns, harsh woods (not *literally* harsh), hard surfaces, tiles, and turn-of-the-century reproductions/furnishings predominate. To put it crudely, the style is reminiscent of a Restoration Hardware catalog spread. That said, it's simultaneously rustic and luxurious. Most stunning are these beautiful globe-shaped chandeliers hanging from above. The ceiling is a pattern of square-shaped frames. My boyfriend and I went in on a Wednesday evening around 9:45. To my surprise, it wasn't very busy. Perhaps because it's a weeknight, or perhaps because Side Door is new? Not really sure. At any rate, we were happy because we basically had the entire restaurant to ourselves... and because of that, we chose a private-ish booth partially covered in drapes. Behind us was a lovely wallpaper that was kinda ""British equestrian club meets Anthropologie home decor section."" Our server introduced himself and was great... but throughout the night proved to be very *very* chatty. Again, I think because we were the only table, we got a lot attention. Nevertheless, I appreciated his enthusiasm talking about the food, their food philosophy, and his recommendations (which were very very thorough). Alright, in terms of food... we started off with the French onion soup. The beef broth for the soup had a lot of depth. The onions were sweet and cooked until tender. The Gruyere over the sourdough was tasty, but it was very hard to cut through the bread without having soup spill over. While the soup was good, I've had better. We also ordered the Lawry's Wedge salad. This is such a classic I couldn't not get it! Crisp baby iceberg, *beef* bacon, blue cheese, scallions, egg, and their classic ""Vintage"" dressing (similar to an Italian dressing) made for a very satisfying starter. These are very basic ingredients yet they managed to up the ante and delivered a winner! For our entrees, I ordered the Side Door Cheeseburger with all the fixings (avocado, bacon jam, roasted jalapeno). I really recommended adding these items because I couldn't imagine this burger without them. The bacon jam was particularly outstanding with the 7 oz. of Angus beef. The brioche was fantastic -- buttery and the top bun glimmered. The House Smoked Pastrami sandwich was also delicious. The brisket was fantastic and I loved the rarebit! It was served on a pretzel roll so you can imagine it being very filling. The giardiniera added both a lovely flavor and color to the sandwich. Lastly, we shared the Pretzel Bread Pudding. My boo and I have a weakness for bread pudding and even if we're stuffed, that is one dessert we WILL make room for. Our server raved about the pudding... and as he should. It was similar to a French Toast -- but for dessert. Dried apricots, pistachio, and whisky (!) caramel topped things off. Even though we didn't ask for it, our server was kind enough to bring out two glasses of milk to eat with the bread pudding. Unfortunately, he came with the glasses during our last bite. Nevertheless, that was still a lovely gesture. On the whole, I recommend Side Door to anyone who loves gastropubs. I personally seek out New American restaurants all the time; it's one of my favorite types of cuisine. Side Door is one of those places that seem to ask: ""Why mess with the classics?"" I'm so glad they feel that way. I'm definitely going back.","4/8/2014","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=urqtKpxG3VM6C2vxhb1ilA","James Z."
"Went for lunch. I got a the Lawry's wedge which was a good salad. We had the fried pickles to start, very good as well. The side of mac and cheese was a great addition to my salad! :)","2/16/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8gqiogyNzG_ZzkW_HG5HLA","Maria L."
"This was a great experience from the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out. I prefer to sit at the bar, and chat up the bartender especially when I'm flying solo. Which seems to be more often than not.. Sounds like I need to make some changes, yet I digress. I started with  a beer flight. Of the four craft beers I chose, I'd say the Green Flash Double Stout and the Miskatonic Pale Ale were the two noteworthy selections. I did also enjoy the Penrose Tripel and the Boulevard Saison. I have to say, the prime rib sandwich was by far the BEST I have ever had.. Ever. And I don't say that lightly. But, to put it into perspective, it's now 5:30 in the morning and I'm still thinking about it. Cut was fantastic the bread was exactly what I would expect, and the Au Jus was an amazing compliment. Thick and rich, vs that watery stuff you get elsewhere. The service from the bartender Sean,was worthy of five stars himself. Extensive beer knowledge, great recommendations on food, places to buy local craft beer and a nice guy to talk to. I'll definitely be back. And if you order the prime rib sandwich, please save me a bite;-)","11/9/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rQXwm28bcVajFTtLrt1jDw","Gino G."
"I was in town for a meeting and needed a bar with dinner. Fried dill pickles: crispy breading and really good. Then the prime rib sandwich... ridiculous! This place is attached with Lawry's so it's amazing! Great beer and liquor selection too!","3/6/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h9bC5NiptE_Nuqc_5_huKA","Adam S."

"This popped up recently in the downtown neighborhood, and I'm sure glad it did because we need more places like this around here! First off, it's inside of Lawry's steak house - just walk to the left when you first walk in. You immediately feel a less formal, less stuffy vibe when you find it: The waiters aren't wearing the old-fashioned uniforms and there's a full bar. It's also cool that jutting into the dining area is a single chef working on your order in front of you. The service was amazing. Our waiter really knew his stuff and actually seemed really excited about the new menu options: he spent 3 minutes describing their best cocktail - the Smoked Negroni, which features small-batch, locally made gin that tastes like bourbon, smoked ice, and other goodies. It definitely has a smokey taste to it and I loved every drop. Next we shared a Roasted Meat Board - which is basically cuts of their best steaks to share. All of their menu focuses on shared plates. You pay full price for your first meat choice (the most expensive: $17 for the Lawrys Roasted Prime Rib), and then 10 bucks for any choices you make after that. We had the Roasted Prime Rib, Prime Angus Sirloin, and the Leg of Lamb. It was all perfectly cooked and delicious, and the various dips they came with complimented each meat well. This place makes a great date spot, or a good place to catch up with a friend in a laid back spot, with an excellent drink menu and delicious portions to share. I can't wait to go back.","4/9/2014","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SgOfHp-JK--Y82h6-Hk6zQ","Chris T."
"Have you ever literally fallen into a small place that you were so happy you did!This is an amazing example of getting SO LUCKY while on our Chicago adventure!This place is a door, and a sign. Don't miss it.Once you step inside it is a comforting oasis! With some of the nicest staff we met during our entire weekend in Chicago.We were brought to a cozy booth, and greeted immediately. The waiter gave us some menu tips and we ended up decided on a few shared plates. YUM!Everything was amazing. I would search this place out next time I a in town!","5/30/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g","Kent T."

"I did not realize this was literally the side entrance to Lawry's prime rib. The interior is somewhat dated with that dark, old steakhouse feel to it. We grabbed a few seats at the small bar and ordered some appetizers and beers. The selection of draft beer was limited, however they did have quite a few unique larger format bottles. The avocado mash with pita was good, with a very strong flavor of line to it. The other appetizer we ordered never came out and we ended up leaving to go to another restaurant for dinner.","5/8/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QVNFi8ssjPtHY5I9M1vb8Q","Ho L."
"This is definitely a place to eat if you're looking for meat. I enjoyed a late lunch here when there were few other people inside, so the service was great. It's hard to get a piece of prime rib in under 10oz however. And the salad they throw together on the side resembles bagged iceberg blend. The burger (which is still huge!) came out perfectly cooked and seasoned. Is was what you call a ""one meal day"".","1/7/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M5MfpY7mf4s8wxcwujh62g","Eugene O."
"I came to this place just for drinks, but I'd love to come back and try the food. This place has the coolest ambiance, a mix of older stained glass and woodwork, with a hipster vibe. You sort of feel like you're in a secret place. We'll definitely return!","12/1/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GeZ8SQhNyAX3dsX4PqLLvA","Samantha S."
"I visited SideDoor on a recent trip to Chicago. It was a great choice. The service was very attentive, but not pushy and the food was delicious. I got the Fork and Knife Pastrami and it was above and beyond my expectations for a pastrami sandwich. The restaurant was cozy and I felt free to linger. I will be returning soon.","4/25/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ig0lruv3zC0FnmVnd-PNdw","Kenzie K."
"Definitely more expensive than $$..the food wasn't worth the price. We had a flight of sliders (normally not on the menu, but there is a new chef who is testing the recipes) - the buns seemed to be like those cheap ones you buy at a grocery store. The ambience is nice and our waitress was friendly. Overall, this place did not meet my expectations.","8/21/2016","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x6-yqAcVKWm3EXGOQ813sQ","Paloma A."

"What a brilliant menu, atmosphere, and set of flavors. Group of 4 for dinner and we enjoyed every bite. Poutine is excellent as a starter. Burgers and sandwiches were perfect.
