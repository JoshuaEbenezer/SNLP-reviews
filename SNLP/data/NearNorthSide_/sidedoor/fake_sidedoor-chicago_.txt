[{"review": "Had lunch there last week. The service was disorganized and far too informal. Our server was rude and very opinionated on a number of topics he knew nothing about. Completely inappropriate behavior for someone in the food service industry. The food was OK but not great. We spent $100 on a lunch for two. Needless to say, there are hundreds of restaurants in downtown Chicago with better food and service.I won't be eating there again!", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "David B.", "user_id": "4WLjNIobFeBclkbIS8cihQ", "review_date": "9/23/2016"}, {"review": "Overpriced dishes and not filling. In plain language, it is a total RIP OFF. I was there yesterday and order a prime rib on the board. That dish was smaller than any appetizer plate I have ever eaten in my life and they charged 20 dollars for it. They charged me 7 dollars for a side dish of fries and 13 dollars for s small plate of asparagus. After I was done, I was still hungry which was rare, because I usually do not eat much. Although they they claimed they are affiliated with Lawry's, but based on my personal experience from yesterday, they are not. Nothing like Lawry's quality at all. Unless you have tons of money to burn, I strongly do not recommend this place and will never go back again.", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "HANK L.", "user_id": "OcPaaTqTxyBpHdHLbiflIA", "review_date": "9/13/2015"}, {"review": "I wish I could say that I tried the food, but I didn't get a chance because of the horrible service. My wife and I went in at 9:15 pm because we had been walking around and we wanted some food and drinks, and their website and yelp clearly says that they are open until 10:30pm. We were greeted by a woman from behind the bar and led to a table where we received our menus. Then some angry little man came out of the back and rudely asked us, \"how did you get in here?\" \u00a0We thought he was being funny, so we replied, \"through the side door!\" \u00a0He didn't laugh, but instead said the kitchen closed at 9 and we could not have any food (again, try to find where it says anywhere that the kitchen closes at 9). He said that the door should have been locked and he led us back out to the front. Then he tried to give us recommendations where we could go to eat instead, and then he and a manager looking guy argued about whether the kitchen was actually closed or not. At this point we just wanted to get out of there, so we left and went to The Purple Pig where we were promptly seated. Maybe it's because I was at the ball game earlier so I came in with a baseball cap on...or because they're just rude.

Was not wowed with service - friend ordered vodka and soda. Drink arrived and there were NO visible bubbles in her drink. She reluctantly sent it back and the server wasn't sure what to do. He brought back a drink in a taller glass saying the tall glass would help keep the bubbles. How about there was something wrong w/ your pop machine? Anyways, I don't drink vodka, but tasted it at her request and there was definitely no vodka in there. The waiter said it must have been at the bottom. They brought out some free brussel sprouts. The person delivering them said they were an extra order and didn't want them to go to waste. Which would have been great, except that we watched the same thing happen to every table around us. Why lie? So silly. Sadly the \u00a0brussel sprouts were swimming in oil, they had to be shaken off to be able to eat them. Hubby ordered the $42 meat plate, which wasn't nearly as \"large\" as the server made it seem. I don't eat meat so I didn't taste it, but hubby said it was definitely not worth the price. He could have ordered a higher quality, better tasting filet at a steakhouse and got more for the money.Nice ambiance, would go for a drink or two, but would not go for dinner again, over-priced for overly oil and \"meh\" food.", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Jacqueline F.", "user_id": "DcHoFXyYjm3ou3hNa8dCgQ", "review_date": "10/27/2014"}, {"review": "The service was great, but the food was just o.k.", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Patricia P.", "user_id": "Fz4-g0fAHiugtAtJLMiO0g", "review_date": "5/20/2016"}, {"review": "Walked in at 6 on at Saturday with two kids. Sat immediately, server Camille gave us kid friendly item suggestions right away and took orders for kids with our drink orders. Smart move. Great beer selection. \u00a0If you sit within line of sight of the cutting station, it will be tough not to order the multi-meat sampler. Had steak sandwich, very tasty. Wife had double cheeseburger, looked great mine was better. Ordered chicken and waffles, daughter ate a good portion despite being picky, kudos. \u00a0Son devoured fries.Nice look, cool door cases and wainscoting, classic.
