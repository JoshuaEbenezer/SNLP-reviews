"Had lunch there last week. The service was disorganized and far too informal. Our server was rude and very opinionated on a number of topics he knew nothing about. Completely inappropriate behavior for someone in the food service industry. The food was OK but not great. We spent $100 on a lunch for two. Needless to say, there are hundreds of restaurants in downtown Chicago with better food and service.I won't be eating there again!","9/23/2016","1.0 star rating","4WLjNIobFeBclkbIS8cihQ","David B."
"Overpriced dishes and not filling. In plain language, it is a total RIP OFF. I was there yesterday and order a prime rib on the board. That dish was smaller than any appetizer plate I have ever eaten in my life and they charged 20 dollars for it. They charged me 7 dollars for a side dish of fries and 13 dollars for s small plate of asparagus. After I was done, I was still hungry which was rare, because I usually do not eat much. Although they they claimed they are affiliated with Lawry's, but based on my personal experience from yesterday, they are not. Nothing like Lawry's quality at all. Unless you have tons of money to burn, I strongly do not recommend this place and will never go back again.","9/13/2015","1.0 star rating","OcPaaTqTxyBpHdHLbiflIA","HANK L."
"I wish I could say that I tried the food, but I didn't get a chance because of the horrible service. My wife and I went in at 9:15 pm because we had been walking around and we wanted some food and drinks, and their website and yelp clearly says that they are open until 10:30pm. We were greeted by a woman from behind the bar and led to a table where we received our menus. Then some angry little man came out of the back and rudely asked us, ""how did you get in here?""  We thought he was being funny, so we replied, ""through the side door!""  He didn't laugh, but instead said the kitchen closed at 9 and we could not have any food (again, try to find where it says anywhere that the kitchen closes at 9). He said that the door should have been locked and he led us back out to the front. Then he tried to give us recommendations where we could go to eat instead, and then he and a manager looking guy argued about whether the kitchen was actually closed or not. At this point we just wanted to get out of there, so we left and went to The Purple Pig where we were promptly seated. Maybe it's because I was at the ball game earlier so I came in with a baseball cap on...or because they're just rude. I guess I'll never know.","8/9/2015","1.0 star rating","8d5emQgwt-UKmyS-Jpn3fQ","Justin S."
"Worst service ever in the bar.  Every time I come here the service just gets worse and worse.  Never going back and it's a shame as the food is so good.  But, it's not worth dealing with the horrible servers.  It's like they go out of their way to ignore you.","12/7/2014","1.0 star rating","6poDfDkEaDcLPwfFPvHk8w","Mary S."
"Cozy place, great to be able to hear your friends or dates talking. Was not wowed with service - friend ordered vodka and soda. Drink arrived and there were NO visible bubbles in her drink. She reluctantly sent it back and the server wasn't sure what to do. He brought back a drink in a taller glass saying the tall glass would help keep the bubbles. How about there was something wrong w/ your pop machine? Anyways, I don't drink vodka, but tasted it at her request and there was definitely no vodka in there. The waiter said it must have been at the bottom. They brought out some free brussel sprouts. The person delivering them said they were an extra order and didn't want them to go to waste. Which would have been great, except that we watched the same thing happen to every table around us. Why lie? So silly. Sadly the  brussel sprouts were swimming in oil, they had to be shaken off to be able to eat them. Hubby ordered the $42 meat plate, which wasn't nearly as ""large"" as the server made it seem. I don't eat meat so I didn't taste it, but hubby said it was definitely not worth the price. He could have ordered a higher quality, better tasting filet at a steakhouse and got more for the money.Nice ambiance, would go for a drink or two, but would not go for dinner again, over-priced for overly oil and ""meh"" food.","10/27/2014","1.0 star rating","DcHoFXyYjm3ou3hNa8dCgQ","Jacqueline F."

"Walked in at 6 on at Saturday with two kids. Sat immediately, server Camille gave us kid friendly item suggestions right away and took orders for kids with our drink orders. Smart move. Great beer selection.  If you sit within line of sight of the cutting station, it will be tough not to order the multi-meat sampler. Had steak sandwich, very tasty. Wife had double cheeseburger, looked great mine was better. Ordered chicken and waffles, daughter ate a good portion despite being picky, kudos.  Son devoured fries.Nice look, cool door cases and wainscoting, classic. If you want good food and a great cocktail and beer selection for a reasonable Chicago price. This is your spot. Great pit stop between Michigan Ave scene and Rush St scene if your just visiting.Only issues, little loud if you sit by the serving area. Also, there are no options for vegetarians, who would not probably come here on there own, but might be a dinner guest.","9/6/2015","4.0 star rating","qQhHOBla4meN2bWn4TeZnQ","Dan R."

"We just happened upon this place and it was a great find. The food here is great and the service has been good every time we've been. I love their meat plates for the table. I think their drinks are priced a little high, so not the best place to just drink with friends. But the food is excellent.","7/19/2014","4.0 star rating","n9Vbcdbg98vRzGtaQ7Ukig","Jason B."

"This place was fantastic!! Our sever John was on point! The food was outstanding, I had the wedge salad and my husband ordered the Brussels salad, both were amazing!

"Stopped in for a drink the other night after work.  The bar is unique with 2 great bartenders and good drinks.  Had an appetizer at the bar, which was delicious.  Will definitely go back there very soon.  Very convenient to work and home.  Remember going to Lawry's years ago.  This menu has some good choices.","11/4/2015","5.0 star rating","BrfcMzs6D74zPd1Wf5-ekw","Kathy M."
"The ambience of this restaurant is great, relaxed, and casual, and while they were busy, they weren't overly crowded and it was still pretty quiet for close conversation. The prime rib sandwich was amazing! So tender, the bread was warm and fresh, the au jus was perfect, and re horseradish wasn't overpowering and was just right! Definitely a must for lunch and/or dinner if you're in Chicago!","10/27/2015","5.0 star rating","XdeiaEtkn9tvdnnfwo5NPw","Nikki S."
"Starting with the food.  You can not go wrong with anything on their menu that's how good it is.  I suggest poutine and pastrami sandwich, and the meat board and cheese burger looked phenomenal.  For dessert we had the sundae and everything looked great.  My dad say the alcohol selection is top notch.           The services was great. We had a friendly waiter who knew the menu well.  The food was on our table in very little time.  Our waiter had a someone shadowing him and it worked out well.         The interior was nice the the floor was weaved black and white tile.  The keys on the wall where interesting and the stained  glass windows where beautiful.   The feeling of the place was warm, imagine in the cold of an Irish winter coming into a pub full of happy people (I am not saying it is a pub so don't let that analogy deter you).","9/1/2015","5.0 star rating","c-FlbDZu4IiYj1oLpsqRkA","Andy P."

"Great food and beer selection. Opportunity to try various Lawry's food at a more affordable price and in a more casual environment. Old school feel with a stunning spiral staircase that gives you the sense that you are in more than the typical gastropub. Meat boards let you sample some great food, poutine is not to be missed and the large format beer bottles will give you an enjoyable option or two, even for people who don't care for beer. I don't make it here as often as I'd like, but when I do I always leave satisfied.","5/21/2015","5.0 star rating","VYC7XM1VQ3SOkkik-8S63A","Dan M."
"I just flew into Chicago earlier today and was looking for a place to get some pub style food near my hotel.I found Sidedoor and decided to come try it out. Awesome beers, great foods. (We had the pastrami knife and fork sammy, pretzels, and crab cakes) Ordered 2 flights of premium beer. This place has a perfect combination of rustic atmosphere & awesome food/drink.

"Let me start out by stating that I do not normally write reviews for restaurants, unless the restaurant actually deserves a review. With that being said, SideDoor was absolutely amazing. I am from  NC and was in Chicago for business and just so happened to run across SideDoor and I am so glad I did! It was chilly out, imagine that, so I wanted a warm ambiance setting with great wine and food. SideDoor was the perfect place and I left with a huge smile on my face and a fully belly!Not only was the food delicious (the french dip is the best I've had to date) but the staff was also so friendly! My waiter, Kelly, was very nice and observant. The ambiance was perfect with the cozy lighting and almost had me feeling like I was in the french county(cooper hood, opened kitchen, could watch the cheese being sliced, etc)-it was perfect!I hope this restaurant is successful and I cannot wait to visit again!","2/26/2014","5.0 star rating","k7eka9VN8wmpeCHpJIY1yg","Blair B."
