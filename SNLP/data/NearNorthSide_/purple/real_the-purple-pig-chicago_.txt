They MUST have something to prove because I was so underwhelmed by my meal, I had to hit the Wal-greens around the corner to get some chocolate-covered pretzels after we left. I had high hopes for this place. A friend of a friend recommended it, and my friends and I had walked past it the day before \u00a0and thought that it looked like a fun place to check out. I have to assume that this friend of a friend is a frenemy. We got there around 4:00PM and it is slightly crowded and that's fine. We waited a few minutes and a waitress brought our drinks out to us. We were seated a short while later at a large table that they deal with family-style. This is fine. As long as you don't have a douche bag 25 year old sitting next you speaking so loudly that EVERYONE on the outside patio can hear. Honestly. Who says, \"I am going to commission a piece from the artist\"? Let me tell you who - this guy. We spent the next hour and 45 minutes listening to him talk over his companions, and the other 9 people seated at the table. I know that the restaurant cannot control this situation, but it just lends itself to our crappy experience. Here's what we ordered: Fried olives stuffed with chorizo - I didn't eat these, but the general concensus is that they were fine. Nothing to write home about. Or even to verbalize to the table. It's a fried olive. Fried eggplant with parmesan - They were OK. A gelatinous fried ball that tasted like cheese. Probably one of the better items from our list.Cheese plate - We had three cheeses: a chocolate goat cheese, a leceister cheese, and some gouda something or other. We didn't finish a single one of them. Seriously, I just needed a freaking Wheat Thin to eat with this. The buttered baguette was adequate, but not special.Pig heart sandwich, Chicago style - My friend ordered this and thought the pig heart tasted like roast beef. However, the sandwich itself was basically inedible. The bread was so hard that she couldn't eat it like a sandwich without cutting it. Here's my beef (or should I say \"pork\") with it: If you are serving me a freaking pig heart, make damn sure all the other pieces are good. Don't serve a rock hard loaf of bread with it. Because then, I am having to work my butt off to eat what many would think is offal. Seriously, the hotdog I had Mustard's Last Stand was a more appetizing choice than this.Chicken thigh kebabs - I know, I know... chicken thighs are fatty. But these were the fattiest, least savory chicken thighs I have ever sunk my teeth into. The best part of the entire meal, I kid you not, was the smashed and fried potato hanging out underneath the meat kebabs. The tziki sauce was fine. I've had better and I've had worse. Pineapple crusted pork something or other - Whatever this cut of meat was, it had a nice crust on it. Which was pretty much the only piece of the meat we could eat. As we dug through the meat, we found more fat and cartilege (bone???) than I would have thought possible. The guy next to me (not the DB, some other guy) had gotten it and eaten every bite. I have to ask myself... Did he eat ALL that fatty tissue and cartilge?? Did he??? If so, I am concerned for his health.So there's the rundown on the food. Now, on to the service. Which I think about as highly of as I do the food. Once we were seated my friend ordered the same drink that I already had in my hand. 20 - 30 minutes pass and no drink. Our waiter (who swapped with our original server) asked if there was anything we needed and my friend mentioned that she was still waiting on her drink. He became defensive and said it was at the bar. If it was at the bar, why not go ahead and bring it out? I made a joke about it and he wasn't impressed. I think if you are going to be in the service industry, you should know how to handle a joke. You are working with the public all day, every day.... deal with it! For these servers, it was a job. And you could tell. I've been to places where it's a profession and there's a noticeable distinction between those two roles. Our guy (and even the girl who we began with) are just there. Posers themselves. We spent the rest of our time at this restaurant waiting out the time so that we could go. I question anyone who swears by this place.

However I've never written a review. I thoroughly enjoy reading all of the entertaining insights on all of the places I've worked \u00a0my 14 years in this business. It helps me to gain new insight in my chosen profession as \"director of cuisine\". \u00a0Not only does Yelp humor me-it humbles me as well. Let me be clear that I am breaking my oath to keep silent- strictly based on a service perspective. I have dined at the Purple Pig enough times to safely say that I have tried almost each and every item on the menu- It is brilliant and undeniably delicious. I \u00a0wake up craving particular items- plan my day around \u00a0how I can somehow squeeze there deliciousness into my break from my double at work. Like an addict I care not of the repercussions. I compare my relationship to The Purple Pig to that of a sick love affair with a married man. I get the meat I crave but none of the true tenderness that builds a lasting relationship. The service is painfully pretentious and unapologetic in being so. Each and every time I remind myself before heading there, not to expect a smile or a thank you. Each and every time I prepare myself for the rolled eyes or blatant ignorance of my simple \u00a0requests. \u00a0All of those issues seem to just dissipate the moment those flavors and textures hit my lips. But I have to say-after today I don't know how much more abuse I can take. I pride myself in the work I do-with the relationships I form with my customers, and I seek solace in putting my pride aside at times when I know I'm wrong.

The service here was TERRIBLE. I have never experienced such horrible service in my life. The staff was also rude.Here's what happened: We showed up at 6:30 last night (a Thursday!), and the restaurant was packed. No worries, we expected that. The hostess told us that our party of four would be seated within a half hour, so we found a place at the bar and each had a glass of wine. A half hour rolls by, and I always get nervous about these things, so I went back up to the hostess and pointed out my boyfriend (who is very tall and noticeable) and said, that is Dave, who the reservation is under, we are standing at the bar right there, so that you can find us. She says, \"Great! You are next.\" So I settle back in at the bar. More time passes, and we are still waiting, so we decide to just go ahead and order the bottle of wine we planned to have with dinner and to start it at the bar. I get nervous again so I send over Dave to check on our status. Once again, he tells the hostess where we are standing and asks about the status. She says, \"a table is going to open up any minute. You are next.\" So we continue to be patient and keep drinking our wine at the bar. At one point, one of the hostesses comes over to us, and my boyfriend says, \"are you looking for Dave?\" and the hostess says, \"are you a party of 3?\" and Dave says \"No, we are a party of four.\" Yet another half hour passes, so we send someone over again. At this point, we are informed that we lost our table because quote unquote \"We could not find you.\" By then we are so frustrated and starved (and drunk) that we just leave. On the way out the door, one of the members of our party expresses our frustration to the manager, and the hostess says, \"Well we looked all over and could not find you. It is not my fault.\" I'm sorry, you couldnt find the 6'3 guy at the bar, 10 ft from the hostess stand, who we pointed out multiple times?

Ok so stuff happens, we ask the busboy if he can please take it back and get a new one or tell the server. \u00a0He comes back and lets us know the server would bring it out because she had to enter it into the computer? \u00a0Still no problem. A server other than our initial one approaches us and states that they are looking at changing the soda and will bring one out asap! Thanks for the follow up, although you were not the server who greeted me, took orders, made suggestions. \u00a0So our entrees come out. \u00a0I had the chicken kabob and my partner had the pork sandwich. \u00a0The sandwich was delicious I actually ended up eating more of that than my entree. \u00a0The kabob really was not that great of a presentation, it actually looked like a plate of slop because of the watery tzatsiki sauce, what appeared to be three potatoes and perhaps the juice or grease from the chicken combining together. \u00a0The chicken was ok, actually my partner liked my dish more and I his so we just swapped. In the meantime we really did not see anymore of our server until the end of the meal and the nice lady who came by earlier stopped by to see how things were. So at this point we tell her about the appetizer she was nice about it and apologized. They did end up taking it off the check. The place is cute, but the exhaust fans must not be working right or they turned them off later in the evening. \u00a0The place smelled like grease/smoky I could not wait to get out. \u00a0Perhaps they were cleaning the kitchen and had turned off the fans? \u00a0Whatever it \u00a0was I was grateful to go out for fresh air. Some suggestions for the servers if you are going to trade off a table, it is customary to let your table know that a new server will be taking care of them so we are not looking for you.

The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be there. In this friggin economy? Maybe if Avec, Blackbird, Bristol, Publican, and all the other restaurants that can deliver on both sides of the dining out experience. It is not enough to just offer great food at 100 bucks a head.

MOST of the seating is at \"community tables\" or whatever they call it, and you are literally sitting at one big table slammed right up against everyone else in other parties with zero separation or barrier. Most places that do this leave a gap of one chair or something, but I was literally brushing elbows the entire night with some random person next to me as if I was on an airplane, and it made it very difficult to have conversations because you heard people around you the entire time. We actually knew this ahead of time and specifically asked for a table, but we were seated at the community area anyway. Even the tables though have basically zero separation and many of them are in awkward places (i.e. right by the bathrooms or right in front of a door).b) The service was good and they cleared plates quickly, but there was a server who literally stared at me the entire time waiting to pickup plates as soon as I was done. It was kind of creepy and very awkward. I appreciate attentive quick service, but he was just standing there staring at me most of the time I was dining.c) All of the dishes tasted great, but a few were soaked in oil and way too salty.If this restaurant were to make a little more space, I would definitely go back and I think my experience would have been much more positive.", "review_date": "1/8/2017", "user_id": "5Uytpq7M8QSDPqdOpKZ9QA", "user_name ": "Karl S.", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating"}, {"review": "Food is ok but overprice by miles but I guess when you eat in Mag Mile thats what you pay for.
