"Came here at 11pm on Thursday. The restaurant was packed, but luckily there was a table available. Definitely try to get here early if you're coming in a big group.Ordered two dishes to split between 2 people just to address our late-night fix.salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio butter- this is a definite must try. Beets were cooked just right and I loved the mixture of the cheese and pistachio butter. Couldn't stop eating this dishmilk braised pork shoulder- this was very good. the pork is very tender and the sauce was rich and perfectly salted. it was a good mix getting the beets and pork shoulder as they complemented each other. however, you can probably do a great job of making pork shoulder that is more or less as tasty, so I would probably try something else on the menu if I come backPurple pig had great food, excellent service, and is located in the main part of the city. Absolutely loved every aspect of my dining experience here, and will definitely return the next time I visit Chicago.","4/30/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oHwvzTeN8bHmqWJg24c2zA","Richard F."
"Great vibe, ambience, crowd, location, menu, staff, service etc.I had heard about the Purple Pig from family and friends therefore I had to try it. Thanks to another fellow Yelper, I decided to try the broccoli. Boy was it fabulous! Cooked to perfection, moist yet crispy topping (panka perhaps), great taste and good portion.I also had the lamb-absolutely a must try. It was tender-the meat fell off the bones. No fat, clean meat and tasty.Also had spicy margaritas very well made.My neighbors had the beef tenderloin and octopus. Both looked wonderful and were thoroughly enjoyed.Can't wait go go back!!!","4/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4D4JwxN07FFDIFswH8E4Ow","Virginia T."
"This place is really out of this world. I have dined at some really nice places in my life and this place is in my top 3. Quite possibly my only complaint is that they need more tables!!! Service: Excellent both times I have been here.Food: I had the salted roasted beets with pistachio butter -- I am still fantasizing about these and will continue to do so. Incredibly delicious, fresh and never had anything like this before. *Must try in my opinion*. I also had a fava bean hummus with sauteed chard with lemon, also excellent. The beets dish is the best thing I have had in a looong time.","4/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WqG56fpM4Tx2KGdkAMN3ag","Priya D."
"The Purple Pig was the restaurant I was most excited about coming to Chicago. I absolutely love tapas/small plates restaurant, all the more reason to overeat delicious foods!My boyfriend and I got here at around 4:50 pm on a Sunday evening before a Second City Show, and there was no wait. We got seated at the end of a communal table. Our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and efficient. She came over and took our drink orders and then answered a couple of questions we had about the menu. We ordered The Pig Platter, the salt and vinegar fried beef tendon chips, the bone marrow, the octopus, and the pork jowl. The Pig Platter: I loved all the different meats and the pickled veggies it came with. The pickles were delicious and went so well with the meat. I loved it!Salt and Vinegar Fried Beef Tendon Chips: It was salty, fried goodness. My boyfriend LOVED it. It was good, but I also felt like I was gaining .5 lbs with every bite.Roasted Bone Marrow: One of my favorite dishes. It was prepared perfectly, and I loved the bread it came with. It was toasted, buttered, and too delicious. The greens that came with it was a great complement to the rich bone marrow. Octopus: When it first came out, it looked like sausage, but damn was it good. The pesto had great flavor, I was a huge fan. The potatoes and the green beans were delicious.Pork Jowl: Our favorite dish. The pork was tender, salty, and so good. We loved the sunny side egg on top, the runny yolk was a great sauce to the salty pork.Some of the dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but nothing the garnishes couldn't help with. Yum. We also decided on getting dessert (even though we didn't need it, but we were on vacation...) He got the affogato and I got the caramel poached pear dessert. We are huge desserts people. He loved the affogato (I'm not a coffee person at all), the poached pear was STUNNING. It looked gorgeous and tasted delicious. I definitely did not need to eat most of it, but that didn't stop me. I love the flavor of the poached pears, and the ice cream was a delicious nice touch. It is communal seating, but that just means you get to check out what everyone else is eating and start some friendly conversations (aka get some awesome recommendations!). Everything was prepared well, service was AWESOME, and it's a fun atmosphere. I can't wait to come back here!","4/19/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QEqHKXoD61jM_Cd6RZuqZQ","Victoria C."
"Ordered: octopus with green beans, bone marrow smears, pork shoulder, pork prosciutto, and cheeses. SERVICE: Pretty minimal contact with friendly demeanors. They have a turnover here, so servers and busboys are quick to remove. If you want something to stay on the table, make sure you assert that. Otherwise, *poof*, it's gone.FOOD: wowza. The octopus was actually the best grilled octopus I think I've had. Which isn't to imply that I am some sort of octopus connoisseur, but I've had my share and this is worth trying. The accompanying green beans are also very well seasoned in salsa verde.The pork shoulder was fall apart tender. It was served with a spoon and I nearly rolled my eyes at how ridiculous it would be to cut pork shoulder with a spoon. Well. They showed me. Accompanying mashed potatoes also amazing.The bone marrow set up was great. Very tender and flavorful. Definitely required a bit a strategy to remove, as bone marrow usually does. There was no cute way to do it. So if you are trying to be cute or polite, this might not be for you. The prosciutto crusted cobia was great as well. Crispy in all the right places, but what really took my heart was the sea beans. Wow.The cheese plate was awesome too. To be honest, I am unsure of which cheeses my lunch mate selected and I didn't want her to think I was a Yelp-obsessed freak (I am.) so I didn't ask her a third time to repeat them. ATMOSPHERE: This place is in a very accessible location, but it should be noted that lines can accumulate pretty easily here. ALL IN ALL: I would definitely come back, and I can't wait to do it.","4/17/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h_sM6nJx5rsQIl1_BrCalg","Devyn H T."
"I love the atmosphere to this place. It's a very open outgoing casual type of atmosphere. It gets crowded and seating can be a bit tight but the atmosphere is great. I like this place. I want to like it more. I want to try everything on the menu. But it's hard when you can only come here ever so often because there is a wait. We got the calamari antipasti which was solid and decent portion size. The rabbit gnocchi was fantastic! And of course we got the milk braised pork shoulder like everyone else does. It was a toss up between 1 more dish of food or dessert. We decided to get dessert and it did not disappoint. WE got their popular Sicilian Iris. It was phenomenal. Every bite was perfectly sweet and mouth watering. I would come back here just to get this. But make sure you get there early if you want it as they usually sell out after 8-9.","4/17/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XqxGzyCZJAsaarZgzutTSg","Dave K."
"What a tasty gem hidden in the middle of the touristy black hole that is Michigan avenue!A+ for service, ambience, and food!Long time Chicagoan but first time at the Purple Pig. Got there at 5pm after work and were promptly seated on the patio. Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Butter -were phenomenal. Portion is perfect for sharing and the whipped goat cheese was plentiful. Just enough pistachio butter to add some weight to the airy cheese and tangy beets. Chorizo Stuffed Olives-6 olives atop some sour of sour cream. Nothing crazy here but if you enjoy olives worth the tasting. Chorizo is a teaspoons worth and breading very light. Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey- My favorite dish of the meal! Tender, perfectly cooked pork steak seasoned well and accompanied by an arugula salad and smear of ndula sausage. Very filling and perfect for 2 to share. We originally ordered another main but were informed after waiting a bit that the chef was unhappy with the result. We were comped any other dish on the house! We went with theChamomile Tea Smoked Pork Leg Steak for Two with Charred Cabbage, Sherry Membrillo & Pork Marrow Custard-Fabulous presentation of two great cuts of pork leg. The chamomile lent itself to the meat in a really interesting way in that it made the flavor of the pork stand out more. The charred cabbage was delicious I could have eaten it in a salad. The sherry Membrillo is a guava reduction and was tangy/sweet, a great compliment to the pork. The bone marrow custard came served in a bone cavity. This was good for spreading onto the meat and gave the leanness some weight. Caramel Poached Pears. Almond Genoa Bread, Pear Ice Cream & Chocolate Veil-Absolutely stunning presentation and flavors. The bread is an almond confection so moist and buttery. This is dolloped with a fair share of tangy, true-to-life tasting pear ice cream and fanned with 4 succulent brandy-poached pear slices under a blanket of smooth chocolate. We will definitely be back for a cheese/meat platter and some wine!","4/27/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eHN3ndlTxXh92Ck7fnkaHQ","Jessie Elizabeth J."
"Went here for my birthday and it made for a delicious meal! Not too expensive for the quality, service and presentation (about $33) but definitely a splurge for a student like myself. We got the calamari, the beets, the meatballs and the pork shoulder. The calamari was unconventional and fresh - a variety of textures and flavors! The beets were BEAUTIFUL. I loved the contrast between the smooth pistachio butter and the chopped nuts. The meatballs were alright. A bit small, bland and dry in my opinion. The pork shoulder was so soft and tender. It pulled apart with a fork and was delicious with the creamy potato mixture. For dessert we got some sort of chocolate pear dessert. It had ice cream that tasted EXACTLY like fresh pear and a hard chocolate shell, on top of a spongy and strange textured cake slice. Service was very courteous! Would go back to try other dishes.","4/25/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MtGHbVMVK_x2PvA02t1Gcg","Catherine Z."

"Everyone, I'd say mostly tourists, are excited about this restaurant. But I don't think it would be so popular if it wasn't on Michigan Avenue.  The Bone Marrow was good. The braised pork shoulder was rubbery, flavorless, and we ate maybe a quarter of the dish because we were hungry. Friends warned me it wasn't great, but I wanted to try it anyways for the hype. We sat outside for dinner at a two-person table so it was quiet, but the inside seemed very crowded and loud.","4/20/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3IvuzypK3H6m6omM2uRHHg","Marisol P."
"The Purple Pig was one of my favorite meals recently. I loved it and will definitely return to try more.It is popular/pretty small, and crowded - there wasn't much room but I squeezed in at the communal table. Service was pretty good, server was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided a couple spot on recommendations that I wasn't planning to order.Foie gras and pork terrine. Amazing. This dish was so good and started the meal off perfectly. I should've ordered two of these for myself. Fried brussels sprouts - loved the texture. Great flavor too, but I thought this dish was a little too oily and over salted. Octopus with salsa verde and green beans. Delicious, perfectly cooked octopus, great flavors in this dish, perfect portion. So good. Gnocchi with oxtail ragout - gnocchi was perfectly cooked and fluffy. The sauce/ragout lacked flavor and there was barely any oxtail. My least favorite dish of the night (the others were pretty exceptional), but still enjoyable and had no problem finishing.The server recommended 2 to 3 dishes. 4 was definitely a lot of food, but I got through it all. Good price for what you get.","3/17/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LHsCa_aVta4UbbrcL4hE5A","David H."
"I'm always hesitant to dine at The Purple Pig, and for good reason. During my third time here, we got some dishes outside of our usual go-to's (octopus, bone marrow) upon the waitress' recommendation. These included dishes like the smoked pork tongue and feta spread with date crackers (?). We ordered a couple more, but nothing comes to mind right now.Dishes were honestly mediocre and lacked flavor. The smoked pork tongue had potential to be good, but the temperature of the dish was odd--with its creamy texture, it was akin to butter that had been left out of the fridge for an hour. Lol. The octopus was also on the lackluster side, and consisted of more green beans than octopus itself. The only dish that remotely stood out in my opinion was the feta spread dish--it was pretty decadent, and the combination of flavors went well together.For some reason, every time I visit The Purple Pig, I end up getting seated at the long communal table with high chairs. I actually highly dislike it, as it provides little private space. Overall, the atmosphere within this restaurant is not to my taste as you have to yell (seriously) to talk to your friends. It was also pretty hard to flag down our waitress to receive our bill as she was rarely in sight--I had to eventually walk up to her when I saw her by the computer and she barely acknowledged me.","4/20/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fj5bAcfeggkXUfwCMewI9Q","Astrid G."
"Holy geez. This place is great and I sure am glad my sister found it. After going to a museum and before going to see Hamilton, my sister and I stopped here for lunch. It was hella busy but we were seated and  had a menu quickly. The tables and isles are very close together but not uncomfortably so. The menu had plenty of chocies but we decided on 4 things, the Bobota (greek cornbread, brussels sprouts, hummus, and a chorizo panini. Everything came out super fast and was amazingly delicious, I don't think I could pick a favortie so obviously get them all.","3/14/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Rx4bHNzBtDSds11Sa-_Q9w","Marcia V."
"After recommendations from friends, Yelp and being a tapas lover, I had to make this stop. After reading the reviews on how crowded and how long the lines could get, my bf and I opted for lunch here. No wait, nice warm seating area inside and outside available. Our server Sergio was great! He guided us around the menu, the style of food and was perfectly attentive. These tapas plates are definitely made to share! Theyre not small portions, but hearty enough for two people, at least three people if you wanted to try extra of everything. The bone marrow was SPECTACULAR. They even explained how to eat the marrow just in case. Extremely luxurious, make sure to use the salt, capers and onions to help cut thru the richness. A must get!The octopus was ever so tender. A little bit much on the lemon for me, but I had no complaints. It was worth getting and the fingerling potatoes were a great touch. FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Theyre not deep fried in a batter, just the leaves were fried to have a bit of a crunch, and they were worth it. They smelled so good, I wish I couldve fit another plate into my tummy. Fried mozzarella bread. It was alright, loved the mustard and radishes, but I wouldnt order this one again. The floor manager was always walking around, asking every table how they were doing, plates were always being picked up, and the service of the entire restaurant itself was great. I would recommend anyone to stop by for a visit or ten when theyre in Chicago!","3/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zYZvNDpf7kmUUvP5Me86TQ","Bonnie N."
"I can see why this place is so popular and has received so much praise! Honestly you couldn't really go wrong with any of the selection - I especially loved the roasted beets with pistachio butter and whipped goat cheese, and the milk braised pork shoulders are so tender that the knife just melts through the meat. Their meatballs, although highly recommended by the waiter and were indeed very fresh and juicy, were not that exceptional so I would suggest saving your stomach for something else. For dessert, we could've probably ordered something better because the poached pear with genoa cake that we got was pretty mediocre. But in general everything really delivered, in terms of taste, quality and portions. The dishes are in small plates and are meant to be shared. My biggest criticism would be that the service was too rushed - we kept getting asked if we were done with our dishes when we were still nibbling our way through the last few bites, or were just taking a break from eating. Maybe this is due to the fact that the restaurant is so popular and it was getting busy so they were trying to be efficient. It's a subjective thing, but I prefer to eat my meals with a more relaxed pace.","4/19/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=29UXoG9rmw3ZVRzdkRqtjw","Natalie S."
"ULTRA VIOLET SWINETerrific tapas and vino tinto are the modus operandi at this *insanely good* Mag Mile restaurant (one of Chicago's hottest).I'd known of this place from LeAnn P, but it wasn't until dinner on 2/22/17 with a certain mom that made me understand why a venue specializing in small plates would have such a strong positive rating across almost 5K reviews.The Purple Pig operates on a first come/first serve basis, which means you can't make a rez to guarantee your party's seating.  Even though you can bank on TPP being crowded at ANY time of the day or night, expect a considerable wait if you arrive after 6pm.Tucked away off of Michigan Ave, TPP (a.k.a. ""The Fuchsia Porker"") has a small dining room and a lively -- but deafeningly loud -- environment.  Communal seating is just how these guys play the game; if you value your personal space and quiet time then maybe this isn't the spot for you.But if you can handle tight quarters and noisy atmosphere, then you will go absolutely hog wild for the items their kitchen cranks out.  Although I would encourage adventuresome eaters to order an entrée or two, it's truly the appetizers and hors d'oeuvres that stand out the most.Before I drop some serious beats on the culinary breakdown, I wanted to give props to TPP's massive wine selection.  I enjoyed large pours of a Bordeaux ($12 per 9oz glass) and noted many others that'd pair nicely with their charcuterie boards.  Now onto the good sh*t:¶ broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, anchovy vinaigrette ($8)One of TPP's signature dishes, the broc was cooked to the ideal level of tenderness.  The breadcrumbs added a lovely texture of crunch and the anchovy vinaigrette was salty without being overwhelming.  A must order.¶ meat & cheese tray (guanciale and hook's blue) with sliced cornichons, crispy pita, & fig mostarda ($16)Instead of jamón ibérico (a personal fave), my mom opted for 'guanciale' which is the fatty sibling of prosciutto.  Accompanying that was a firmer, milder blue cheese (when compared to your typical Stilton or Roquefort) as well as crispy pita triangles, sweet-brined cornichon pickles and a delightful fig mostarda.¶ duck liver pâté with lightly dressed field greens, grapes & crostini ($12)The pâté itself was lighter than air and the plating was tasteful, but otherwise nothing terribly out of the ordinary.¶ potato ice cream with ossetra caviar, purple chips & crème fraîche ($18)Runner-up to best dish of the evening was this whimsical cold plate which was JUST as awesome as it sounds.  The potato ice cream was unlike anything we'd ever tasted and reminded us of the ""french fries"" liquid nitrogen dish from our meal at EL Ideas.  The crème fraîche atop the striking purple chips was a snazzy touch.¶ salted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter ($9)This was the one that brought me to tears.  Diced beets were plated with a miraculously airy goat cheese and a very unique, VERY good smear fashioned from pistachios.  Imagine the greatest, smoothest peanut butter ever made, now add in a touch of honey for sweetener and you'll get an idea of what this was like. MARVELOUS.¶ Meyer lemon bar with olive oil sorbet ($9)This dessert was the perfect balance of flavor and texture: a tart lemon curd over a shortbread base and crispy rice pearls, with a subtle olive oil sorbet and light caramel drizzle.  Tangy and playful!¶ Poached pears with amaretto cake, pear sorbet, & chocolate gelée ($9)Easily the best-plated dish of the evening, the attention to detail was exemplary.  Pears poached in red wine along with a refreshing pear sorbet joined a wonderful amaretto cake and an unusual sheet of cocoa gelatin.Bread = 5+Circuses = 5Service wise, it really couldn't have been much better.  The level of attentiveness matched that of many Michelin places and despite not receiving any ""explanations"" of dishes, everyone from the guys who cleared the table to the girl who sat us were both polite and vigilant.  We never encountered a problem and water glasses rarely (if ever) got below halfway.  Pure professionalism.:VERDICT:Jimmy Bannos Jr and his staff of servers, hostesses and chefs absolutely SLAYED IT.  Every single person working here had a great upbeat attitude, although it was the kitchen whose stellar plate presentation and flawless execution of dishes left me stunned.  A legit dinner for two with drinks + tax + tip ran an even $200, but it was worth. every. penny.Without a doubt one of Chicago's best restaurants and the greatest meal I've had in many moons.  A superlative experience from top to bottom, I'll be recommending The Purple Pig to not just friends & relatives, I'll be preaching the good word to randos on the street......so if you see some crazy guy running up and down Michigan Ave shouting things about salted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter, pay him no heed......he just really, really likes TPP (and he thinks you will, too).","2/24/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w","Eric S."

"Ever been to a place where you read something on a menu, and you really have no idea what to expect, and then the food completely blows you away? Presenting: The Purple PigI hereby solemnly swear to never travel to Chicago without eating at the Purple Pig. To skip this restaurant would be an affront to your taste buds. You will be reported for neglect. When I read the menu, I can never picture exactly how the food will look in front of me. This is because everything they create is so decidedly unique and adventurous. I try to find clues by googling key words online, but my efforts do little to produce an accurate representation of what I am about to experience. My last venture, had me sampling lamb ribs, gnocchi, and a whipped feta schmere. I am not even going to try to describe the food because I don't think I will have any more success then their menu does, but check my pics to gaze upon glory.

"Finally made it to this place and it was very good but wasn't out of this world. With how many reviews this place had I was expecting more. Small plates is the way to go when you want to try many things and I love that but these were definitely overpriced for what it was. Now some things were AMAZING like the Bone Marrow and Octopus but everything else was just ok. Definitely overpriced for what you get. Now I have said it before and I'll say it again and I don't care how much it costs as long as its worth it I'll pay through the nose but if it doesn't match what I'm paying then its not worth it. The Bone Marrow and Octopus was but the others were not including Pig Ears and the daily special Ribs. The Cauliflower was good but not fantastic. We did end with the Sicilian Iris which was amazing! Perfect way to end because its nice and light and not heavy. Overall I would give 3.5 stars.

"I've been here twice and had a great experience both times. Great ambiance, but be prepared to wait as this place always has a line.One of your best bets is to wait on someone to leave at the bar so you can dine there. This place is pretty pricey and slightly overrated so I'd come here more to celebrate a special occasion. Although, be forewarned they don't do anything for your birthday besides bring the dessert (that you pay for) out with a candle.

"The Purple Pig is a must try! If you're a foodie, you have to eat here.ANTIPASTI:Broccoli - this is amazing. I never thought I would say ""I've had the best broccoli of my life..."" but it has happened. The flavors are outstanding, and broccoli is tender. I just love this. 5/5Calamari - this is pretty good. I love the fregola (this dish actually got me into cooking with Israeli couscous) They dress it with something lemony, and honestly, I'm very partial to lemon so this dish was a win. The actual calamari is very well prepared, and very tender. 4/5FRIED ITEMS:Pigs ear - this is soo good. I'm used to carnita-style pig ears, which are chewy and yummy, but these are very krispy. They could've been anything fried, honestly. This dish is still flavorful, though, and enjoyable when eating. 4/5SMEARS:Roasted bone marrow - this is my favorite, and the reason why I keep coming back. The bread, the herb mix, the salt, the buttery bone marrow.. mmm. 5/5A La Plancha:Octopus - the octopus itself is tender and juicy, as well as the potatoes. But they give more potatoes than octopus so it leaves something to be desired. It's still good, though. 3.5/5OTHER:We've had this meatball type dish before with brioche. I don't see it online, or maybe I overlooked it. This was very mediocre. The menu stated the dish came with brioche. So my boyfriend and I were thinking at least one slice, right? Wrong. It was the tiniest disk in the world. What a rip off and huge disappointment that was. 2/5They've also had their play on ITALIAN BEEF. Now, come on, we're in Chicago. How cool is that? I was very hesitant about it, not gonna lie. Both my boyfriend and brother wanted it, though, so I went along. It was so freaking good! Too bad it was limited. They served some of the juiciest, most tender, most flavor-impactful beef I have ever had. 5/5DESSERT:Lemon Panna Cotta - pretty good bc I love lemon. Sometimes the texture is off. I love the crunch from the pistachios, though. 3.5/5Sicilian Iris - my boyfriend adores this dessert. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but he is and we both love brioche. This is good for maybe 4 bites and then it becomes too much for me. I think he'd give it five stars, though. 4/5Greek Donuts - I don't know what they're called and I don't see them online. They're really yummy, and dripping with honey and cinnamon. I really love these fluffy balls. 5/5I know my sections/titles don't match the menu in the place. I was going solely based off of the menu on Yelp.I love the food here, and I'm pretty sure I have enjoyed every single thing I have tried. I'm giving 4 stars, though, because the service here really lacks sometimes, which sucks. Don't you guys work for a tip? Anyways, the food is always good so a solid 4 stars!","1/15/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iTcfCd_vBI0SEXjLemBYJQ","Sabrina S."
"I'm pretty sure I experienced The Purple Pig entirely all wrong and I still loved absolutely every moment of it.You see, this popular Chicago spot was, without a doubt, one of the most lively restaurants I've ever been to, with packed communal seating, a copious amount of shared plates, an endless wine list, and an ever-present drone of spirited conversation. My approach? I was alone, sat at the bar, drank beer, ordered only two dishes, and spoke only with my waitress. Like I said, entirely all wrong.So, given my circumstances, why did this place feel so damn right?First, I credit the open-air kitchen. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations, so when I arrived to an overflowing scene, I figured it was a long shot. The hostess offered me an empty seat at a communal table, but even as someone who doesn't mind dining alone, I declined that out of fear of being some weirdo intruder alongside a large party of old friends. I then tried my luck at the back bar and was able to score a solo spot. Little did I know that this was front row to one of the most exciting, fast-paced kitchens I've ever seen. Watching the line cooks shout and prep and plate and joke, all in some unison form of communication was symphonic and aggressive and mesmerizing. I was enthralled by this uncanny form of theater, and would recommend you go enjoy the show if you happen to randomly find an opening back there like myself.Second, I credit the food. After a quick bit of research and consulting my waitress, I ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, as it seemed to be the most popular dish at the restaurant. Yes, the name at first gave me ""Always Sunny"" Milk Steak vibes, and yes, the plate itself looks like a fatty lump covered in gooey mush, but let me tell you, this is absolute pig heaven. Sitting on a pillow of mashed potatoes, drenched in gravy, and garnished with puffed farro, the pork is so tender, the side of your fork cuts through this like a blade. This is rave-worthy, mouth-watering stuff.This dish alone was probably enough for one person. But I sat there, marveling at the organized chaos behind the bar, immersed in the scene, thinking to myself, ""Am I really only going to order one thing? Am I really going to just up and leave right now?"" So I went for the Octopus, which arrived chopped and stacked in a pyramid of green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde. Our eight-legged friend is a pretty regular order for me in Mediterranean restaurants, but the treatment here at The Purple Pig was not your typical charred-tentacle-on-a-plate creation, but rather a tossing of said ingredients in a flavorful, land-meets-sea medley of sorts. Not to mention, I was able to shovel all of it down despite being full from the pork in the first place. I paired both with an easy-drinking Off Color Apex Predator saison (OK, maybe two), because... when in Chicago, ya know?Now, I would typically never take to the interwebs after sampling such a small percentage of a restaurant's menu, but the fact that these two dishes were so damn delicious gives me the rare vote of confidence that the rest of The Purple Pig's plates can only follow suit. If there's anyone willing to test the limits of this menu and prove out this theory with me, I'm game. Otherwise, I'll be in the back, at the bar, by myself, watching those cooks make magic happen in the kitchen.","3/23/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sSveQQvgkDrPbpopNvbPSw","Dan R."
"Finally got to try this place out. Went on a Saturday afternoon expecting a long wait but was seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter came right away to greet us and offer something to drink. He was very knowledgeable when it came to wine and made sure it was a good pairing with the entres that we wanted to get. Anything you order from the menue is ideal to share, unless you absolutely love something that you are not willing to share. We ordered bone marrow, which was delicious!!! Followed up with mozzarella melt that had a great crunch to it. Ended with  JLT Pork Jowl, it was so delicious that I wish I didn't share ;).","4/3/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=a6JmdZfpYeCeITQeWoADcA","Yuliya M."
"If my review was based on a single visit (first time), then it would certainly qualify for 5 stars.  The reason for the 4 is based on consistency.Ordered a few of the same dishes the second time and was thoroughly disappointed since our expectations were so high from the previous experience.For the most part, the choices are usually all pretty tasty and it's hard to go wrong with any option...but like I said, consistency is key for me to keep coming back.Don't bother with the bone marrow dish- there are countless places in the city that not only serve this dish, but serves it better and for a lower cost.","1/31/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_o66mUpo6mc2AMWLmEOglg","David N."
"So out of the 5,000 reviews this place has, you've stopped to read mine huh?Fair enough. Makes me feel special.Relatively pricey tapas is the name of the game here, but that doesn't mean they aren't delicious. Get the bone marrow like your life depends on it. The richness of that marrow spread on the toast is wonderful. If it's too rich for you, there's some salt that accompanies the dish to help you break it down a bit (and help you achieve your salt bae dreams).It seems like everything my party got here was amazing. We ordered the octopus, cauliflower, Blade Steak, Half Duck, and Pork Shoulder. We all had the chance to sample some of the plates and agreed unanimously that they were great choices. Someone in our group even claimed that the pork might have been the best they ever had. High praise.It certainly wasn't cheap, with the average price coming out to be slightly more than $30 per person. It's also extremely crowded inside and since they don't take reservations, you might be waiting for a bit. There's a reason it's popular though; if you want a great dining experience in Chicago, the Purple Pig is as tried-and-true as they come.","3/26/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MNC4xBMbc6gY4I9Ji96E_w","Daniel B."
"Within an hour of touching down at Midway for our Anniversary Weekend, my wife and I made the Purple Pig our first stop during our first visit to Chicago. It ended up being the high point of the weekend, which is no way a slight toward several other places we went. To sit at a relatively small table in a packed restaurant is usually my personal dining hell, but I really didn't notice. The atmosphere was great, the staff was kind, attentive, and helpful, and the food was awesome.We split several dishes, all of which were delicious, but the Seafood Saganaki was...man. Acid, spice, and brininess all together in every bite. I wish we had gone here a few more times, instead of wasting money at places that were twice as expensive for a quarter of the quality.","4/21/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WKOLB-ftBjP_zV9qSGB5Nw","Mark B."
"""Everything on the menu is awesome"" is what our waiter told us and he wasn't wrong.For a table of 5, we got 8 dishes to share and they were all delicious. My favorite ones were the pork blade steak, carrots and pork, roasted bone marrow, pork shoulder,and the broccoli. Everything was well cooked and flavorful. The bone marrow was really delicious when spread upon the bread. I know people really like the pig ears (apparently a fan favorite) but to me they were just crispy fries and it wasn't that appealing to me at all. But the fried egg on top was a nice bonus I loved that they kept the dishes continuously coming rather than all at one time. It was also very helpful that with each dish, they would give you tips on the best ways to eat it. I wish I had gotten pictures of it because the plating was so pretty. A nice place for hanging with friends, a romantic dinner, or just if you want yummy food!

"Last meal for 2016 and first for 2017On our way to watch the Chicago Rising, we wanted to grab some grub and warm up a little bit with some brews, and this place was conveniently right down the street from the event.Herbert did an awesome job with his recommendations on tapas selections and beer. Rating from 1-10, we ended the year 2016 with my favorite being the Lamb Ribs(10) and Roasted Bone Marrow(9) thus starting 2017 with some Pancetta-wrapped Guinea Hen(8) Beef Brisket(8) Smoked Scallops(7) and Crispy Pigs Ear(9). All the food came out at a steadfast pace giving us just enough time to finish each plate.  Beer wise, I chose their Moody Tongue Chocolate Churro Porter from Illinois which happened to be the perfect combo for my taste buds.Can't wait to come back for some more tastings!","3/1/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg","Lawrence M."
"This place blew my mind.My party and I came around 7pm on a Saturday night and were quoted a two hour wait for a table in the dining area. Instead of waiting that long, we opted to order on the outside patio, where the full menu is available. Be warned, there are no chairs to accompany the tables; however, the wait time for food was not that long, so its bearable.Once our server greeted us, we asked what he'd recommend. Like any other server at any given restaurant typically says, he said everything was good... at least five times. Even when we asked him to choose between two options several times, he continued to reiterate that everything was good!But I completely understand why. EVERYTHING -- and I mean everything -- was phenomenal. We ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, the Octopus with Green Beans, the Short Rib with Pomegranate Seeds, and the Turkey Leg. Each of our four dishes had a distinct flavor profile that left me on Cloud 9.The only thing we weren't overjoyed with were the cocktails, but the food made up for it!!","12/21/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pE-Pw82WqEtlDCwB-jc_ow","Niki P."

"The ""hipster"" sitting next me wearing a Greek fisherman cap and an ironic tee shirt commented, ""That rillette looks amazing. Is it?"" The Purple Pig is that kind of place. The seemingly uninformed, are. The rillette was indeed good. Everything I have ever eaten at The Purple Pig has been good, if not great. I don't live in Chicago, but with the exception of Blackbird (another Chicago favorite) I've eaten here more than any other place in the city. I first dined here shortly after opening. Since, I have popped in whenever I could and NEVER have been disappointed. The only disappointment typically arises when I can't get a seat. When people ask for Chicago recommendations, The Purple Pig is always on the top of my list. After these many years, it was good to gain affirmation of over a decade of support. This time I was enthralling by the Milk roasted Pork Shoulder served over the creamiest of mashed potatoes and deep fried farro. The Deviled Egg was a unique twist, stuffed and breaded, then fried. Hummmmm! The lemony dessert was also very fine. With this restaurant and this food it is virtually impossible to find a flaw. I simply cannot say enough good things about this place. Order anything and then order another dish because you'll want it.

"My review is solely based on the food quality. I recommend visiting here if you are in Chicago. I ordered:Pork shoulder - This dish was perfectly cooked, the flavor of the gravy was not overpowering and the portion size was just right. The meat was tender and didn't have any fat! I sat at the end of the bar bc it was the only spot available unless I wanted to wait 15-20 mins for a shared table. The waiters/tresses picked up all drinks from the bar to my left, which wouldnt have been too bad if they didn't stand there and gossip. I learned all sorts of good stuff about the staff including who was actually good at pairing wine with food. I expected that the bartender would give me a brief description of the food items or maybe even make a recommendation.

"I'm so glad I finally made it out to the Purple Pig!! We (3 of us) came in on a Saturday night around 10pm and we were seated right away; it was busy but not as busy as I thought it would be.  It was snowing so not sure if that was a factor.  We chose to sit at the bar vs one of the communal tables.We had the following small plates:-Bone marrow smear with buttered, toasted bread and herb salad.  I loved this, one of my favorites of the night-Pork shoulder with mashed potatoes; truly melt in your mouth delicious like other Yelpers state!-Ricotta gnocchi, tender and very good.  I thought the ragu sauce was just ok though-Pork belly, an explosion of flavor as my sister said! Another favorite of the night, our only complaint is that there were only 3 pieces -Tenderloin beef slices, I was so full and probably on my 3rd or 4th glass of wine :) when we got this but  I remember this being very tender and flavorful -Fried brussel sprouts, this was probably my least favorite and I thought it was bit salty.  I wish we ordered the broccoli insteadWe ordered 2 bottles of a French red (cab/merlot blend); they have a very good wine selection.The service was very efficient, they worked as a team and food came out fast.  It was fun to sit at the bar and watch the food get made.  I would love to come back to try the fried pig ear, broccoli and octopus.","12/11/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lgNM7aQ2LMGlCZVxSTLYHg","Carla M."

"I strongly feel like this place is OVERRATED! The food was okay, definitely doesn't worth the wait (1-1.5 hr). One thing I find the person who assigned table was quite RACIST. I decided to take a friend of mine who came visit to Purple Pig for something nice. We went in right around Purple Pig open, so we didn't have to wait in line. I guess the person who assigned the table assume that we are Asian, so she decided to put us at an awkward corner sharing table with another large party of Asians who were also there for celebration. I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AT ALL. I found it VERY disrespectful.(We are all Asian doesn't mean we should be all squished to one table!)I, then, asked if there's any other table open. The lady just gave me a look like I annoyed her. We were later seated in the back on the outside closer to the kitchen entrance, but it wasn't terrible (comparing sharing with a large dinning table to a Large party). Food for that price... I have to say I would spend the same amount of money else where for better food. In general, I don't think it worth the wait nor the price.

"4.5 stars to be precise!Having heard a lot about this place and what its doing with its offerings, we definitely had this locked on our bucket list for this past weekend. Ambiance : Chilled Out, Bar Style, Casual. The Bar style is important as the place can get quite loud to the point you can't really hear your own partner if you've come here simply for its food. Service : As expected of a place like this although being that it was so heavily packed when we went in, it was impressive that there was ONLY a hint of tardiness between meals.Food : Ah the stuff that makes this place so famous. We tried the famous ""Roasted Bone Marrow"" for appetizer. The marrow was silky and oh so good! Shame it was too little though. They serve only half the bone so the portion is minuscule if you're going to share and will end up scraping it across your toasts.               For the Mains, we tried the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Octopus with Green Beans. Now truth be told, I'm a picky pork eater but damn was this one of the best Pork preparations I've had in quite a while! The pork was cooked so perfectly that despite being stringy, it withered away with tenderness! And boy o boy that mashed potato was like butter! Combine them both and you were in pork heaven! Amazingly, for the other dish too my sentiments were almost similar. The Octopus was chunky and yet so tender and juicy it's worth applauding that the chef cooked it to perfection! And for the accompaniments, I don't usually crave greens with my meat, but those beans and potatoes were so well seasoned and pan fried that I couldn't stop eating them!!. A lot of superlatives going here but stay with me coz we now come to Dessert. As recommended by the server, we tried the Sicilian Iris. A warm and freshly made beignet stuffed with gooey goodness of ricotta and chocolate! I didn't know those two played so well before :). Suffice to say, I prefer this ""stuffed"" version of beignet over that traditional sugar dusted non stuffed ones any day!!Now I know there are tons of gastronomic delights in Chicago to choose from, but if you're ever here, please do visit this place!!","2/15/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0RmBe3_3nXLE6bGiC8FvGA","Akshay S."
"I was under the impression that this place served small tapas and plates but everything I ordered was bigger than expected. We expected a long wait and were told over the phone that the wait could be 2-4 hours during the dinner hour so we decided to come at around 10pm to avoid the wait. We still had to wait for a table but we were given the option of ordering from the full menu and eating at the outside patio if we wanted. We decided to stand around a table outside and order from the menu (no seats but we didn't mind standing and eating since the table was tall). Eventually, by the time we figured out what to get, we did end up getting seated inside. Amongst my four friends, we ordered the Tom & Jerry steak, the turkey leg confit, and the pork shoulder. We later realized that it was a lot of meat for a late night meal. Everything was really good but because we chose all meat dishes, it did get a bit salty without some vegetables to balance it out. TOM & JERRY STEAK (Meant for at least 2 people)This was the most expensive item we ordered but because it was meant for at least two people, it's actually on par with the other individual entrees. There is bone marrow in the center that our server said you can spoon out and put on top of your meat like ""butter"". Steak overall was very good especially with the sauce. TURKEY LEG CONFIT WITH CRISPY LENTILS, NAPA CABBAGE, & AGRODOLCE I never thought I would like lentils but it gave a nice crunch and I found this dish balanced well when paired with the cabbage. The meat was tender and it came apart off the leg very easily. Since the turkey leg is so huge, I think you can easily share this dish with a friend. MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOESThe pork shoulder was also quite tender but I think I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy more as the gravy was delicious. I had the highest expectations for this dish since it seemed to be the most mentioned in the reviews but it actually fell short of my expectations. If you like pork and meat, then this restaurant is the place for you. Everything we tried was delicious and flavorful but it does verge on being too salty at certain bites. I wouldn't wait two hours for here but I would come back again at around the same time at night when the wait is way shorter and it is less crowded. I imagine that the wait is this long probably because people are spending a whole hour to finish up their bottle of wine.","12/21/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZGTuCOVq7I4bsyypXAFcLw","Diana C."

"After many recommendations - both Yelp and from friends, my wife & I visited last night. Thankfully, despite the warnings, we walked in and were seated immediately.  We sat inside at a cozy marble topped table for two. They also have an outside area, that's covered and heated - and is much quieter than inside. There was music pumping so conversation was tough - between the music, people speaking loudly to get over the music, and the occasional staff yelling to announce food is ready!  Service was great - polite and on top of things - both our waiter and the servers that rushed the food to your table when it was ready.  The cocktails were on the small side, but were also on point...unique, flavorful and not too weak.We ordered the almonds, pig ears and cannoli - all were delicious. Our least favorite was the ""tater tots"" - we were not a fan of the sofrito.  The carrots & plantain dish was delish and was our favorite.  We stopped there, in an effort to preserve our waistline and pocketbook. However, there's a distinct possiblity we are returning tonight to get the Brussels sprouts, pork shoulder and fried cheese :) My only real complaint was the noise...if only they'd turn down the music a couple of notches.","3/23/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cfl9KM4kRC03Ns6ErGhRxw","Mike I."
"This place is one of the hot dining spots in chicago, especially for tourists. My sister and I got there for dinner, and there was a wait. but they had a outdoor patio area where you can still order some appetizers and drinks while waiting, they had heaters too so that was nice since it was freezing in Chicago during that time. When we got our table, it was a shared long table. Our server was very nice and recommend some popular items. These were the items we ordered to share:-Octopus (with green beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde) - Super delicious!!-Pigs ear (with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg) - Crunchy, felt like i was eating fries haha-Sicilian iris (for desert) - sweet, it looked like a beignet -Razor Clams with oregano, lemon and olive oil - appetizers, soon good! wished it was bigger-Lamb ribs - I usually DO NOT like lamb because it's too gamy, but they did a wonderful job of covering up that gamy flavor of the lamb. Super tender-braised pork shoulder - very soft and tender as well!Everything was delicious. Very interesting and strong flavors. The only thing for me was that everything was so strong in flavor that it was tooooo much flavor after having too much of it. I can definitely see why this place has the amazing reviews that they do. Service was wonderful, atmosphere is fun, and food was very unique and a must try. However, eating too much of it made me feel nauseous personally just because i'm weak sauce when it comes to TOOOO much flavor and I guess mixing all those strong flavors in my mouth in one dining experience.As you can tell, this is probably just a personal issue, so I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig.We enjoyed our dining experience very much.","2/20/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cXRv-LkLMUR4_bNvc67rDw","Katelin N."

"Before visiting Chicago, I asked 3 unacquainted  friends for restaurant suggestions, and The Purple Pig was unanimously recommended. Despite the high expectations, the food totally blew me away. I visited at about 4pm on Saturday, and the place was already (still?) packed. We were lucky enough to get seats at a long table right by the entrance, but the location did lead to some awkward and uncomfortable bumping as people entered and exited the restaurant. As far as food, we went with the roasted bone marrow (spread), the broccoli antipasti, the clam and cuttlefish brodetto, and the milk braised pork shoulder. Each was delicious and flavorful in its own way. The bone marrow was essentially meat butter and was a tasty spread for their perfectly toasted bread. Topped with some sea salt and salad, each bite was so well balanced in flavor and texture. The brodetto was served like a black pot pie and its cool appearance drew the attention of others sharing our table.The broth was terrific (although very hot, like magma hot), especially when soaked up by the octopus ink pita bread. My favorite dish was the tender and juicy pork shoulder, which was a much bigger portion than I expected. It should come as no surprise given the restaurant's name, but they do pork really well. My friend's favorite was the broccoli, which was crispy, fresh and loaded with roasted garlic flavor, then topped with toasted bread crumbs for an extra crunch. I know it's only February, but this might go down as one of, if not the best meals of 2017. I can see why people love this place, and like my friends before me, I will be recommending The Purple Pig to anyone visiting or living in Chicago.","2/10/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KvqKPFEpmN-VKUtRkoDeVA","Lee Roy C."

Should've been two marrows... maybe California restaurants are more generous?Gnocchi - Pretty good. Firm on the outside, doughy on the inside. Well made but I don't think it was housemade.Milk braised beef - Must get.

Staff was nice, we were served by the bartender and he was very attentive. Ordered wine but I noticed they have a lot of cocktail choices, wish I got the chance to try them! Noticed a lot of patrons drinking the night away there!My friend and I split the JLT Pork Jowl ($13), Squid stuff with Prosciutto ($15) and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13). We weren't starving when we came but still hungry and we're full by the time we got our last dish. Everything we got was amazing!! I think the flavor that was definitely most intriguing and memorable is the Squid. The black sauce that it comes with brought the dish to a whole other level! Wish I could eat it again! This place definitely seems like a cool spot to hang out with some friends. Mind you it gets busy though. I was kinda glad it was only 2 of us. I think prices are fair given the type of restaurant, service, food presentation and atmosphere. I wouldn't say cheap, but fair. Will definitely plan on revisiting this place if I'm ever back in Chicago.","11/17/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wWfQzlgxd9-SntrW8_M8VA","Emmy F."
"I'm not sure where to start. We LOVED this place! We came around 7 pm on a Sunday and they were pretty busy but we were lucky enough to be seated right away. We had called about 10-15 min before and they said there would be a 20-30 min wait. The food was spectacular. I've never been so impressed before. We ordered 4 items:Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt - OMG. Delicious. It's served as a spread with bread. We've never had bone marrow with bread before, but it was amazing. Everything went so well together! And I especially loved the herb salad with capers, it complemented the bone marrow so well. MUST TRY! $14Beef Tenderloin & Beef Cheek Pie with Horseradish & Broccoli Ice Cream - the meat was super tender and melted in your mouth. The horseradish was like a mousse. The broccoli ice cream was different too but both went well with the dish. This was our least favorite dish but we still liked it a lot, we just didn't feel that WOW factor. $20House Cured Sardines on Toast with Avocado Green Goddess, Salsa Verde & Fennel - this was a really great dish. It wasn't too fishy and had the right balance between toppings, toast & sardine. All the ingredients went very well together. $12Last but not least..Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes & Puffed Farro - hands down our favorite dish of the night. Another MUST TRY! The meat was so tender and it just fell off and onto the fork, ready to be eaten! I enjoyed the contrast in texture of the farro and the pork shoulder. Again, everything went so well together. The mashed potatoes were more like a puree but it was good. $19Overall, this place is packing with flavor and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! The dishes are portioned fairly well, and I would say the prices are pretty good for the most part. If only they had another location in California!If you're thinking about whether or not you should try this place or not, JUST DO IT AND GO. Trust me, you won't regret it.","3/5/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h_IxHplvi_W80fXIjDYDSA","Charleen B."
"Stopped here on a Sunday around 1:30 PM and my husband and I were seated right away.We ordered four plates to share between the two of us and it seemed to be just the right amount. Granted, we weren't starving when we arrived.We started with the roasted Brussels sprouts which were great. Moved on to the bone marrow which we had never had before. I enjoyed it more than my husband but was glad the greens were supplied, as it balanced out some of the greasiness. My husband loves lamb so we went for the lamb ribs next. The flavors were great, but there was too much BBQ sauce on the ribs and it overpowered the taste of the lamb. I literally took most of the sauce off.Finished with the pork shoulder, which was my husband's favorite. Tender and full of flavor! Service was attentive and we always enjoy eating tapas so we can both try new items.","11/12/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AK8q2vlPo2WvR-6WUEc2Sg","Karen B."
"Came in for lunch on a Wednesday around 12:30 and there was no wait to be seated for a party of 2. (: In general I found everything too greasy and too salty. Our waiter was super friendly and we ordered almost everything he suggested (what they're famous for/staff favorites).Broccoli (Antipasti) - It's hard to go wrong with roasted garlic! It was drowning in anchovy vinaigrette though. Very salty.Roasted Bone Marrow (Smears) - My favorite dish! Very greasy but delicious. It comes with salt but I preferred it without.Housemade 'Nduja (Smears) - This was very strange. The bread had a layer of something sweet under the cheese, and the nduja (spreadable pork salumi) was very salty - I guess we should have put less but they gave us a lot. The giardiniera (pickled veggies) was pretty good, but it was just all a strange combination that did not go well together.Pig's Ear (Fried Items) - Nice presentation. TOO SALTY. The pig's ear pieces were fried to a crisp so you couldn't taste it at all. They were also sliced super thinly before frying so you don't get the actual texture of pig's ear either (I love eating the Chinese style of pig's ear salad). The crispy kale was delicious.Octopus with Green Beans - The octopus was really nice and tender. The taste of parsley was too overpowering though. Very greasy.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - Apparently what they got featured on TV for. The pork was very tender and fell apart really easily. Once again, too much salt. The mashed potatoes were yummy!Wish we had room for dessert, but we ordered too much food and had to take home a lot of leftovers. Did not really feel like it was worth the money though. ):","4/4/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=59YUTbsoKBLjLbT4qLvyPQ","Connie F."
"I've been wanting to try this place every time I'm in Chicago but it just never worked out. I finally got to go for dinner and I need to go back soon to try everything else on the menu.I went on a Monday evening around 6:30 pm and we got seated right away (just 2 people). There were a few tables available and some seats at the high tops but by 7:30 it was pretty packed. Everything on the menu are served as small plates and I think it's great to share so you can try a little bit of everything. Each person could prob order 2 things at least and you'll leave satisfied and full. The service was also excellent. The waiters were very attentive and food came out at a good time. They also were really good and spot on with their recommendations. We started out with cocktails, the sun n done and nick n liz. Both were really well crafted cocktails just depends if you prefer vodka or bourbon. We had the swordfish checkerboard crudo; the fish had a very subtle taste so you were able to taste everything that was placed on it, I can't even remember all the stuff on it but it worked. The bone marrow was one of my favorite dishes we ordered. The portion was big and it can definitely fill you if you don't share. Another dish we ordered was the fried pig ears and crispy kale. It was topped with a fried egg and you just cracked the yolk and mixed it all together, you can't go wrong with that. My absolute favorite dish was the lamb ribs with Israeli couscous and pomegranates. The ribs fell off the bone and the sauce was the best thing ever. As if we just didn't have the best meal ever we wanted to try the dessert. So we got the sticky date cake and the panna cotta. The sticky date cake with the orange frozen yogurt and pistachio butter sauce is an absolute to die for dessert. Overall one of the best meals I've had and I think for the quality of the food and the portions this place isn't pricey at all. There's a lot of options on the menu and everything looks unique and different so I definitely can't wait to go back and try some new things.","1/31/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=s-kmSDkixx6Vw_n7hmMPsw","Jessica P."
"Wow. WOWwowwow!!I bookmarked the Purple Pig on a whim when searching online for potential dining places close-ish to the Theatre we would be going to and the Museum we would be visiting beforehand. And just...wow.I am sure it helped that we came in for an early meal very shortly after they opened on a Saturday morning. We weren't there more than 30 minutes after they opened, but they were already almost full! It helped that there were only two of us...It is very close inside. Tight aisles, very narrow ways between tables. If you aren't at a bar table, butts will be in your face. But you know what....it was ok. They are in A1 prime real estate, so I get making use of every single inch of space.I was a little confused about who our server was at first. Water was brought by one person, a menu and inquiry about a drink order from another. And then the third and final server came by to take our orders.The food...was really wonderful! We shared four dishes: the Bobota ""Greek cornbread"", the brussels sprouts, the hummus and the chorizo panini.The food came out surprisingly quickly, especially considering how busy the kitchen must constantly be and how packed the place is. The same can't be said for other tapas places I have been to (*coughArtesanoInLouisvillecough*) And that food....absolutely delicious! I love all brussels sprouts and these might be my favorite I've had! Teach me your waaaays! I wish i could have spent all day there, eating everything on the menu...but schedules and and my wallet said no.All said though, with tip, we paid about $50. Which I think is a pretty great price for a meal for two people in Downtown Chicago. I assume this place gets insaaanely busy during peak times. If you are willing to wait, it is certainly worth it! Or....go mid-afternoon if you can swing it.","1/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AQGMTHae70n3MnONotAuYQ","Kathy V."

But one bite of these and I knew I would have to polish off the ribs. + Burrata cannoli - fun and tasty!+ Beet salad - sounds boring, but actually amazing+ eggplant smear - YUM+ tuna - seared with egg, olives, potatoes.

"3 hour wait? Sure, no prob, we'll just take 2 bottles off your finest wine.Drinking... drinking.. drinking.... finally in! The service was lacking off the bat, but due to the place being at capacity it's understandable. But then again for how much you pay, I honestly still don't care how many people you've attended to - don't project your bad day/attitude on me. Food was forgettable, but i can still remember bad taste. We ordered most of everything on the menu, and we only found 1 item to be appetizing. Won't be back anytime soon - only reason for the 2 stars is because of the awesome wine list and beautiful patio.","10/26/2016","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Fk90pPwjyRao-OU4Zbml5A","Michelle P."
"Heard great things about this place and had to try it! It's a must for those loving tapas and wine!We tried:Pig ear - too fried and a bit too oily. It lost its original texture, but I can see it's an interesting way to serve this item so more would try it.Selection of cured meats and cheeses. Jowl, duck proscuitto, jamon serrano... cheese with truffle? This was delicious! I wanted to order more meat and cheeses! Octopus - tasty and well cooked, not rubbery at all.Mix of meats with different sauces - meat nicely cooked and sauces were great. There's one sauce that was spicy - my favorite!Seems like the is always a wait for this place so you're lucky if you can get a table. There are long communal tables outside, but it'll probably be really cold once temperatures drop. It's likely one of the more expensive meals we had in Chicago, but so delicious!","2/7/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gPh8rpoOq2hjyhF2pAdn2A","Lillian C."
"I use this place as an excuse to go to with tourists. Honestly, I'd eat here all the time if I could, but it makes sense to save it for visitors. The location is great and it's unique enough with communal dining and different dishes, but not TOO crazy to scare away the non-locals.I'm obsessed with the bone marrow - I always get that and the pig ear. I'd get those two, the goat cheese with beets and pistachios, a bottle of wine, and I'd be super happy. And if you don't want to wait for an hour, don't go during popular times. Last time I went was a Sunday at 5:30 and I only had to wait 30 minutes. Heads up though - it can take awhile to get your food as it comes out dish by dish.","2/16/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FDK7ye1bleQcXpxzV8T0Zg","Beth M."

"I am impressed by the texture of the meats at this restaurant and the astounding service even when seated at the bar (sit at the bar for shorter waits!). We ordered a flywheel, roasted bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, lamb ribs, beef tenderloin, and affogato. Unfortunately, we were served two of the better dishes before the other two and were slightly disappointed by the latter. But the simple dessert was a nice wrap up. The roasted bone marrow was served first and was delicious! The server also briefly taught us how to eat it properly when he served it to us. The acidity from the salad, the sea salt and the smooth fatty bone marrow on top of a nicely toasted toast is a combo that keeps you wanting for more. Next, we were served the beef tenderloin which came with something like a fancier beef patty. The star of this dish is really the beef tenderloin with the sauce around the plate. I have never had such tender beef. The milk braised pork shoulder is covered in a light coat of gravy and served on top of very light and fluffy mash potatoes. While I love the flavors of the gravy, pork and mash potatoes, there was just too much pork for two to enjoy. Regardless, the pork itself was cooked to perfection yet again and it easily fell apart in my mouth. The last dish was the lamb ribs. The ribs were covered in too much of the smoky sauce, which was too strong of a taste for my liking. Again, the lamb meat itself tasted delicious; it was cooked perfectly and slid right off the bone. To finish the dinner, we ordered the affogato dessert which is vanilla bean gelato with a shot of espresso. It was a delightful, light dessert. The service here is impeccable. The multiple servers really made sure we enjoyed our meal entirely. I would love to visit again when I'm back in Chicago and try all the other items on their menu!","2/16/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=N7Wvh6UZUyGt5ZsDQlKmSw","Alyssa W."
"DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK!Well actually, since I was away from reviewing for a little while due to being locked out of my previous account (and not being able to reset the password) and decided to create a new account and earn my Yelp Elite status back -- so yes, it is a comeback.To initiate phase #2 of my Yelping experience, I decided to start with the tourist favorite and ""no reservation haven"" The Purple Pig. With so many great restaurants here in Chicago, we both have always avoided this place due to the fact that there is usually a long wait because of their ""no reservations"" policy. Yet, we decided that a Monday night a 6pm couldn't be THAT busy. We were partially correct about this. Although we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, the restaurant was definitely still packed to the brim throughout our dining experience. Pro-tip: If you have only two people, you will have a MUCH shorter wait than if you have 4 or more people.The food for the most part was pretty good, especially the Pigs Ears and surprisingly enough, the Caramelized Carrots. However, my biggest gripe was how SALTY certain dishes were. The main perpetrator of this was the Octopus, which was accompanied with green beans and potatoes and was covered in a Salsa Verde. However, rather than let the flavors of the Octopus and Salsa come through, the only flavor I got was ""salt"". We politely let the waiter know and he brought us a second dish that was MUCH better, so definite plus for customer service -- just not a fan that I had to ask for something to be taken back at a semi-upscale restaurant. If I had friends come in town and want to eat there, I would first check the calendar and time to make sure it was not a Saturday at 7pm and would probably go back because it was pretty good food. However, this is not a restaurant I would seek out to go back to on my own.","4/5/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pbXJ_gWVS5t-YcwjPPkSOQ","Ross H."
"I just... it was... the food... no words. It is loud, crowded, and busy which means not much ambiance. But the food. THE FOOD. The flavors are adventurous without trying too hard. We had a bunch of tapas/antipasti dishes: the roasted cauliflower salad, the roasted beets with goat cheese, the pistachio butter smear, the cornbread, and tuna. And the chicken kebabs with tzaziki. It was all incredible. The beat dish was perfect, sweet, salty, vinegary, and the coast cheese was the perfect amount of richness to both cut and complement the beets, and it was topped with chipped pistachios. I don't know how to appropriately describe each dish other than all the flavors perfectly complemented each other. They also have a pretty incredible wine menu. It's huge. The tempranillo our waitress suggested was again, perfect. For how busy they were and how crowded it was the service was fast and some of the friendliest we experienced visiting Chicago.

"One of the best dining experiences! The food was top notch! Must try their milk braised pork shoulder, it was melt in your mouth tender and the mashed potato pairing with it was fantastic. I also tried the octopus with green beans and fingerling potatoes, and I must say by far the best octopus dish I have ever had. The bone marrow dish which is supposed to be their signature and most liked dish was a little scarce in serving, me and and my husband took like two little bites of it and it was over, kind of like just for tasting purposes. I loved their desert wine - croix du mont. over all fantastic experience! Can't wait to try their other menu items!Service and Ambience -Loud music in the background, seats placed so close to each other that you might mistakenly eat food from your neighbors table haha! When we came we were told there is 1 hour wait, on sat afternoon, but then someone canceled their reservation and we got our chance in like 10mins. Waitress was very sweet and food came out quickly!

"Goosebump-inducing is how I'd describe the meal we had here. My friend and I were just walking around Chicago when I noticed we were walking past this place around 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. It was pretty crowded during lunchtime, and I heard of the long waits here, so we made a quick pitstop as this was perfect timing. We had no wait and were seated at one of the high-top communal tables, though I wish we sat at the bar area where you can see the chefs prepare everything. I've never had bone marrow before so I was all for ordering it after taking a quick peek at all the Yelp tips, and we also got the pork shoulder. We split the two appetizers and a couple of drinks and that was more than enough. Keep in mind, we had just eaten a full meal so I wasn't hungry at all! I finished everything that was left as my friend tapped out from the flavor and density of the bone marrow and pork shoulder. The bone marrow came out topped with this cilantro and onion mix that was tossed in some kind of oil (or maybe even the marrow juices), with some salt on the side, perfectly toasted and buttered bread, and the humongous bone that was the star of the show. The kind server instructed us to spread the marrow on the bread, toss some of the cilantro mix on top, and sprinkle some salt. My skin pricked right up on my first bite and I got the shivers, it was that good! I normally hate cilantro, but everything just went great together.The pork shoulder was also amazing, and just melted in my mouth. There was this cheesy mashed potato on the bottom and drizzled on top of the shoulder that put this over the top.This might've been my favorite meal I had in Chicago, and it was totally spur of the moment (my favorite)! I really can't recommend this place more, even the service was top notch. During the time my friend was catching his breath outside from the richness of the marrow and pork shoulder, a server came by and refolded his napkin perfectly. The little things definitely still matter!","10/8/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Kk4k6bjtHYk3RRkt0DJRPg","Matthew L."
"If you're feeling like trying something exotic or something new, then the purple pig is for you!As a visitor of Chicago, the purple pig was highly recommended by the locals, and I can see why! My friend and I came here on a Friday evening, after a long day of exploring downtown Chicago. We came in between the switch of the lunch menu to the dinner menu. Which we had the option of ordering from both. I got the pig ear as an appetizer, then had the bone marrow, and ended the amazing meal with some lamb ribs. Surprising the pig ear was very crunch but was very addicting! I could not stop eating. Just when I didn't think it could get any better, the bone marrow came. It's a very unique dish where you scrape off the bone marrow from the bone and put it onto the bread. I'm not a huge lamb fan, but decided to try it based off of the reviews on Yelp. It surprised me! The lamb was sweet.Word of advice: make a reservation! Or arrive early if you don't have a reservation.

"A Chicago dining hotspot and honestly one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Period. Be warned they do not take reservations and this place is very very popular so if you come anytime close to dinner you will surely have a wait before being seated and I can only imagine waits get very long on weekends.I came here for a late dinner on a tuesday night after getting out of a show at Second City. It was a little after 10 PM when I arrived and though I was seated immediately after walking in the place was still very busy. The best way to describe Purple Pig is a smaller and somewhat cheaper version of Girl & the Goat. You have to be a bit adventurous if you plan on dining here otherwise this restaurant is really not for you. The menu here is a bit exotic and as the waitress put it the name of the game is to try as many little plates as possible until you are filled up.I started my meal off with the calamari, fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios dish. This dish was a good start but it just didn't pack the out of this world flavor I was expecting. For my second course at my waitress's recommendation I went with the lamb ribs with harissa, treviso marmalade, Isreali couscous, and orange. Now this dish definitely had that out of this world flavor I was searching for. I quickly added it to my list of top five greatest things I've ever eaten. According to the waitress that is their most popular dish. To finish my meal I went with the squid stuffed with prosciutto and bread crumbs with santorini fava puree and charmoula. This dish was excellent and very flavorful as well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Service is great here. All of the dishes came out pretty fast. The setting is a bit crowded and you are in relatively close quarters to the tables adjacent to you. Its quite loud in this restaurant so expect to talk loud in order to carry on good conversation with your dining companions. Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants I've been to. Next time I am in Chicago I will definitely be back to try more of their menu.","10/1/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ozVlStttOsOZ7TqJIxGq8A","John K."

"Had to stop by again.. This time to try some other dishes and of course, order the charcuterie platter again. Charcuterie board: Got the premium platter this time, where everything was house made. There were at least 15 types on the platter. No pates or terrines this time, but everything was good in their own way. Standouts: blood sausage, tongue, lardo, and some others I couldn't catch the name.Pork neck gravy: This is like a glorified marinara sauce with tender, shredded pork neck meat and fresh ricotta, done up where it's just enough savory, sweet, and creamy that made for amazingness on bread.Pig tongue: another favorite that combined contrasting flavors and textures, but worked so well. The tongue tender and tangy. Wish it was more than just three bites..The JLT: The JLT or pork jowl (cured pork cheek) was also a favorite. The unctuousness of the jowl was soo good.

"The short: This place is built for carnivores, but I ventured over for some beets, eggplant, and ice cream that didn't disappoint. Vegetarians it's worth a try - just order a bunch of sides. The long: The Hype: This place is hyped. It is literally one of the first places mentioned everytime I ask for a place to eat in Chicago. It was crowded at 10pm on a Wednesday night, but I got a spot at the very corner of the bar. The Looks: I Instagram-ed the entrance because it looks straight out of an old time movie about Chicago - especially at 10pm on a rainy day. It's right on Michigan Avenue so the whole street is beautiful. The food looks amazing too.The Taste: The bartender/my waiter told me I could basically get the whole left side of the menu (not 100% true) which is tapas. I was going to order 3, but he cautioned me so I got 2: the beets and the eggplant. Beets - Wow I took 1 bite of the beets with the pistachio yogurt and my brain started tingling (not sure how else to describe it...). Definitely an almost overwhelming amount of favor. Eggplant - The eggplant was less intense, but still packed with flavor and served over grilled pita bread with black garlic purée. A good filing vegetarian dish. Olive Oil Gelato - Probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Cooled down my stomach after all of the intense flavors. Glad I came - it was worth the hype! --------------------------------------------------Request for business -  mark things off with a little (V) for vegetarian on the menu?

"What can be said about Purple Pig that hasn't been said already? The food here really is amazing. My girlfriends and I came for a ""snack"" in between meals when visiting Chicago but after finishing our mouthwatering tapas we definitely wanted more. We couldn't stop talking about how great the food was for the rest of our trip.-Roasted bone marrow: flavorful and delicious. -Pork shoulder: perfectly cooked that it just melts in your mouth especially combined with the mashed potatoes. Mmmm, this was our favorite!! -Salt and vinegar beef tendons chips: crunchy and had the right amount of vinegar that it doesn't become overwhelming.-Chorizo stuffed olives: tasty but we weren't crazy about this dish. Thought it was a little pricey for 5 olives. Purple Pig is a must try when visiting Chi-town. Keep in mind these are all small plates that are meant for sharing. Also, there is almost always a wait. Come in and put your name on the list, they'll call you when your table is ready. There's a lot of shopping near by to help you pass time.","10/24/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VbMJW1_jeqI-lWe6-vXcWQ","Lisa H."
"Chowed down here after running the Chicago Marathon. There were a lot of other runners here celebrating. The place was jam packed but the service was still excellent. The bartender recommended an excellent beer called Off Colour which I really enjoyed. Light, a bit fruity and so refreshing. A marathoner's gotta re-hydrate, you know. And to re-fuel, I selected a whipped burrata-filled cannoli with corn salsa that was absolutely delicious. Of course we also had their famous bone marrow smear with crusty bread which was every bit as good as everyone says. By then we were feeling great and just relaxed and enjoyed our surroundings. The inside was quite cramped and noisy but once we moved out to the enclosed patio, there was more room and it was lovely. The food here is amazing. I will keep going back to this place every time I'm in Chicago. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose.","10/10/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_A8CO1V40LPIkXqE-LTYTg","Linda M."
"I have to start by saying that this place is a hole in the wall, which makes it an extremely crowded place. I was intimidated by the amount of people inside the restaurant and outside. We decided to give it a try since we wanted something different from our usual dinner choices. I am glad we got passed the accommodations, which are by no means ideal, as we had to seat on a large, stool high table with a bunch of other strangers. The food was absolutely worth it. We ordered three dishes from the ""a la plancha"" section of the menu. The milk braised pork shoulder was so tender, that we didn't need a knife and was surrounded by a deliciously gravy drenched mash potatoes. The meatballs were very soft and flavorful as were the chicken kabobs. Portions were perfect for sharing but definitely work as a standalone meal.Awesome food and now that I know they make tasty stuff, I may get more adventurous choices like pork sweet breads or pig tail","4/13/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EeCnlfj8RSIC5cWH7wZwoA","Lina L."
"The plates are tapas style, so, shareable bites. We enjoyed the wine (#177) diver scallops, the ice cream potato chips, octopus, and the pork shoulder. David, our server, was incredible; very much part of the experience. Finish off with an amazing lemon bar? Perfect dinner with friends.","4/27/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=w5rTlfs_wuKjU3GmaB5Q5g","Jen H."
"We had heard about this place from others. My friend and I went for tapas and wine. The menu was incredibly creative with very unusual and delicious combinations. We seriously moaned in delight as we made our way through various tapas. The wine was very good--sorry, I forgot which one we had. Our server was OK; it was busy and he was not particularly attentive. It is very crowded so not a place for an intimate dinner.My chair was broken and I cut my finger on it quite badly, but the manager was very attentive and concerned. He gave us a free half bottle of wine for the hassle (probably should have footed the whole bill, actually). I would definitely return there because the food was really quite amazing although expensive. Would give it 4-1/2 stars due to service and crowded use of space.","4/13/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=skHoHBuD6Zufr1hJaW4eBQ","Susan S."

"Our experience at The Purple Pig was a Yelp 3-star ""A-OK."" The food was OK (presentation was great) and the service and ambiance were good.I chose The Purple Pig for our group (of five) for lunch because it popped up on Yelp as one of the highest-rated and most-reviewed restaurants on The Magnificent Mile. We were already on the Mag Mile, so I wanted to choose a place that was within walking distance. The Purple Pig is located near the south end of the Mag Mile, a few blocks north of the river.This is a modern, happening tapas (small plates) restaurant with a bar, covered patio, and open kitchen. The restaurant isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. It's popular - at the time of writing this review, it's already got 4,581 reviews (!) - and it was packed during our Sunday afternoon visit around 1pm. They *do not* take reservations. It's first come, first served. We were lucky and were seated immediately at one of the communal high-tops near the kitchen.As with any tapas restaurant, the dishes here are best shared. I asked our server, Andi, to give us her recommendations and she starred all the popular and most suggested items on the menu. This list should give you a good idea of the restaurant's offerings as well as pricing:Antipasti:* Broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette ($8)* Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers, & pistachios ($10)* Charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons, and parsley ($9)* Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette ($9)Smears:* Roasted bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt ($14)Fried Items:* Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg ($10)A La Plancha, Etc.* Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde ($16)* Turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, napa cabbage, and agrodolce ($17)* Pork blade steak with 'nduja and honey ($17)* Squid stuffed with prosciutto and breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and charmoula ($15)* Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13)From the above recommendations, we ended up going with the broccoli, calamari, pig's ear, and octopus. In addition, we also ordered:* Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki ($14)In general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I can't say I had a favorite. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and flavorful enough (for the most part).The anchovy vinaigrette made the broccoli a bit salty.The calamari wasn't as my friends expected (fried calamari). Instead, the calamari was more like a cold pasta dish with lots of fregola (small pasta balls, similar to couscous) and thin, tart, vinegary radish and cucumber slices. Out of the dishes we ordered, we left the most of this one behind.The strips of pig's ear were hard and crispy (kind of like chips). I think our table was in agreement that the ear strips were kinda bland. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.There really wasn't enough octopus to go around in the octopus dish. What little there was was good, however. Thick and flavorful.If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be the chicken thigh kebabs. The tender chicken and filling potatoes were simple, tasty, and comforting.Andi did an excellent job taking care of us. Dishes came out from the kitchen as they were ready, instead of all out at once (Andi asked us what we preferred and we chose the former). A Purple Pig branded glass bottle of water was left at our table so we didn't need to wait for refills on water. All of the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly.There are only two single-stall restrooms and there was always a line for the restrooms throughout the entire duration of our visit.","9/8/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg","Daniel B."
"We came at 5PM on a Sunday and there was no wait. They serve great flavorful creative tapas so it is a great place to come with a group of friends (they have big tables inside).We started of with the pork tongue with macaroni salad. You can skip this one. It was good but tasted similar to Bakkwa (Chinese pork jerky). The fried pig's ear with crispy kale and egg was amazing. We also had broccoli with lemon vinaigrette (good veggie option, but not as interesting as other dishes). The bone marrow was very generous (we got 2 big bones and 6 slices of toast). Very rich. The octopus tentacle entree was great (tender) but we were quite full already.Don't miss their dessert. We got 10-layer nutella crepe with banana sorbet and marshmallow and it was a bomb. My girlfriend loved it.","11/5/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JKVvXX-hdybAf0f2ZJ9vrQ","Norases V."
"Everything I tried at The Purple Pig was extremely rich and super salty! A few dishes here were unfortunately so salty to the point that I couldn't actually eat them. But I still love the concept and innovation and have heard so many great things about TPP over the years that I'd consider giving them a second chance in the future. If you're visiting Chi-town for just a little bit and don't want to spend all your time waiting for a table, just aim for a later dinner and you should be okay. If you were planning on doing some major catching up with an old friend or something, just be prepared to sit pretty close to other random customers and possibly share a table. Just take it as an opportunity to meet awesome new people!","3/29/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u2VHGBc2VkUZHIzdP0DtiQ","Ann H."
"Worth the wait!  This place is always busy. I came here for dinner and the wait was 2.5 hours... Which meant I would have to eat at 11:30pm which I couldn't do. But i did come here the next morning right when they opened and we didn't have to wait. I actually got really lucky because it was already packed and there were only a handful of seats open.Food: well you know I had to try the bone marrow. I demolished that like no tomorrow. Basically, it was delicious so you need to order it when you come here!2nd dish: we ordered the pork blade that came with a small side of salad. It was pretty good but not as amazing as the bone marrow. 3rd dish: I ordered two types of cheeses with fig and pita chips. I wish I ordered this first before I demolished a giant piece if pork. But everything I ate was really good here. Overall, I give this a 5/5 because of the fast service, great food selections and portion sizes, and not too expensive but still worth the money food prices. I will be back!","9/5/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=S9VYcFNU_YR0JQbwmmdZPA","Sarah A."
"Came here with the girlfriend after a disappointing dinner at a supposedly good restaurant. We got to the Purple Pig around 9:30pm and we were seated immediately. Luckily, we still had a good appetite for this fantastic restaurant. We were kindly greeted by our attentive waiter and he gave us remarkable suggestions about what dishes to order. As a result, we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder and the fried pig ear. The milk braised pork shoulder was heavenly and literally melted in your mouth because the meat was extremely tender and soft. This dish was such a good value too because the portion size was large enough to split between two people and it came with a good amount of creamy mashed potatoes. If you come to Purple Pig you have to order the pork shoulder, it's definitely one of the best dishes that they have! Unfortunately, the fried pig ear with crispy kale was a bit underwhelming. The small fried strips of pig ear did not really taste flavorful and it seemed as though you were just eating fried bits of dough. However, the dish did come with a perfectly cooked fried egg and the kale was flavorful and crunchy. Overall, the fried pig ear could use some improvement in perfecting the flavor of the pig ear, but this dish is definitely a good value. If you see Purple Pig on Michigan Avenue and if there is no line or wait, then you have to come visit this amazing establishment. Even if there is a wait, Purple Pig is totally worth it.","3/30/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5WoEc6cQwyA9kufJNi6Yow","Johnny C."
"I found this place from yelp since this place is with very good rating.  I made my stop in a Friday afternoon for a drink. Wow! This place was really crowded. I was able to grab a seat by the bar. I was sitting there for about 10 min and not being helped. But after I finally had an eye contact with the bartender, I got help right away. And the service was really nice and attentive.  By recommendation from the couple sitting next to me, I ordered two small bites from the menu-whipped burrito cannoli with butter squash and broccoli and roasted garlic. The whipped burrito- it looks like an Italian desert but with both sweet and savory taste. It's a simple taste but was amazing. The roasted garlic- this was really cool. While you can still enjoy the original taste of broccoli and also you can enjoy the flavor of garlic and vinaigrette.The interior was cozy and no wonder it's a popular place in Chicago!","10/16/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DNmGVmGPvwr88suI7P3lCQ","Ashley Y."
"Came for lunch, and talked about said lunch for the next two days. Went back for dinner; have talked about said dinner for the two days after that! Remarkable food, efficient and gregarious staff, and a great wine list make The Purple Pig an amazing option for any occasion. Over our two meals we tried the salt-roasted beets with goat cheese (AMAZING), various charcuterie (all very good, though occasionally a little thickly sliced), the chorizo sandwich (good, but less standout), the lamb ribs (really tasty, but a little cartilage-y), and the olive oil poached tuna (fantastic!).At lunch, a water carafe was placed on our table, but our glasses never made it past half empty before a roving server filled them from his/her own pitcher, particularly remarkable as we were at the just-got-off-an-airplane level of parched. Truly impeccable service.At dinner, we were expecting a 90 minute wait, but spied two chairs at the bar. As we headed toward them, a gentleman stepped protectively in front of them and we pulled back. He called out to us, saying ""No, no, I work here--I'm guarding these for you!"" The bartender (Alan/Allen?) was charming and cultivated a playful atmosphere that led to us making some new friends at the bar and having an altogether wonderful time.

"I'm really glad I came here on a Monday at 3 pm because I was able to avoid the wait that everyone seems to be talking about! Was seated immediately but still surprised to see the place half full. The food here was really amazing and is deserving of a 5 star rating. The antipasti we ordered, Broccoli with Roasted Garlic, Toasted Breadcrumbs, and Anchovy Vinaigrette, was the best broccoli I've ever had in my life. We also had the Fava Bean Smear, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Picked Cherry Peppers, and Fried Egg (amazing, esp when the yolk broke), and the lamb with couscous and pomegranate (flavors were too intense but good nonetheless). After trying the food here, I questioned why Purple Pig only had 4 stars.Based off of my experience, Purple Pig gets a 4 instead of a 5 because of the obnoxious waitress we had. It was raining when we went to Purple Pig, so my bf let me wear his rain boots. They were too large for me so when I got new ones and gave them back to him, he put them on the wrong foot. The first thing our waitress said to us as soon as we were seated was, ""JUST SO YOU KNOW YOUR SHOES ARE ON BACKWARDS"" (caps to exemplify her loud tone). That could have been whispered. Secondly, I ordered a glass of sparkling wine with my lunch and the waitress asked to see my ID but didn't do so for the other person in my party. I think it goes w/o saying that if you card one person in the party, you need to card the whole party. But on top of that, as I was reaching for my ID, she surmised, ""HMM YOU MUST BE A '94.... OH YOU'RE A '95, THE 21 CLUB!"" (again, caps to exemplify loud tone).. Like, thank you for announcing my age to the restaurant. When it was my bf's turn to order a drink, he wanted a pinot noir.. the waitress' response was ""No, why don't you have this instead"". Going with the flow, my bf said sure, but didn't like her recommendation so sent it back. She then brought out another red w/o consulting him about what it was going to be (and he didn't like that choice either). She also said ""you must not have a lot of red experience""... (IRL my bf actually refuses to drink anything but red). We switched staff in the middle of the meal and the second waiter was a lot more calm. Anyway, the service aspect of my Purple Pig experience provided considerable amusement, if anything.tl;dr = great food, nice ambiance.","1/17/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=l2BKLmsvlaTKMEPcZBDPCw","Jessica C."

"Another Chicago hotspot that you should plan in advance to visit.  The place was packed.  Unfortunately, we didn't know we'd have to plan in advance.  So, when my coworker and I arrived, the place was pretty full.  We waited about 40 minutes for a table and it was pretty late in the evening.  When we were finally seated, it was at a large family style table with other people we didn't know.  Not all bad for me because I'll talk to anyone.  I just feel bad for the people who had to sit next to me (leaning over their shoulder all like...""hey, what did you get?""  ""what brings you to town?""  The point is, the food was good - if you're anti-social, this isn't the place for you.","4/21/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GVyI78wozUCt7UWyW1j0Hg","Tiffany N."
"Had a wonderful visit while on a trip to Chicago! The person I was traveling with had been told to go here for great small plates with a Mediterranean feel, and we weren't disappointed at all. It's a small spot and seems to be full constantly. We only waited about 5 minutes before we were taken to a small table. Our server was wonderful and explained how everything worked. She told us to order everything we wanted at first and she would space it out for us. We decided on a handful of plates to try a little of everything. First, the country bread with whipped lardo & cultured butter. It was absolutely delicious. The bread was almost griddled, and had a French toast feel to it. It was delicious. Next, the bone marrow with a parsley & caper salad with bread. The bone marrow had GREAT flavor and the bread was delicious. Also on the bread side (we love it can't you tell??), salt cured Greek yogurt with an apple-pistachio compote. It had almost the taste of goat cheese and the compote was sweet and tangy. Keeping with the carb theme, homemade potato tots (""patatas bravas"") with a Harissa sauce and some other sauce. They were tangy and delicious. For veggies, we had the broccoli with roasted garlic, breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette. This dish was DELICIOUS. Super savory and tangy. It was my friend's favorite dish of the night. I absolutely loved it, too. My favorite dish of the night was roast chicken thigh kebabs with roasted smashed potatoes on the most amazing tzatziki I've ever had. This was seriously so good. They also have an incredibly extensive wine menu, so there is something for everyone. All in all, go here. It's wonderful and you won't be disappointed.","1/20/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u-UdLTffTXLW6ivKl40mtA","Katelyn M."
"I work across the street from Purple Pig and always see a line forming around 6pm during the weeknight. I once went at 5:30pm on a Thursday and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. Yikes. So when a few friends wanted a spot for drinks and dinner after work, I suggested Purple Pig. It was wonderful. We got there around 5pm so there was no wait and we were able to sit outside.Drinks: we all ordered the sangria, both red and white. The red sangria was tasty, but the white sangria was much better.Food: we split the pig's ear with crispy kale, lamb ribs, and roasted bone marrow. The pig's ear was delicious with the right amount of salt. The lamb ribs were fall off the bone tender. The roasted bone marrow was a large portion; super rich and enough for three hungry adults. The panna cotta was split for dessert, which was the perfect way to end a meal. It was light and complemented our more decadent items well.","9/6/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cwNhokfrvEItsjYl-d57vQ","Jen D."
"I think I've done it.  I'm pretty sure I've found the best restaurant in Chicago.  The Purple Pig delivers on every demand a foodie could want.  It has been a few months since I've left a restaurant this happy.This little tapas style restaurant is pretty much always on a wait.  If you want in, come on a weekday around 9pm+ in my opinion.  Secondly, you should know that the majority of their tables are community style, so be prepared to have people staring at your food...as you should be doing to them.  While normally I'm not into community style tables, it works here due to the tapas atmosphere.  The servers do not rush you, and do not make you commit to a certain amount of food off the bat.  As a matter of fact, our server told us to only order a few and look around after eating some, and then order more.  We did that with the family next to us.  We kept comparing dishes and talking about what we liked, and disliked.Our server also did an amazing job explaining the menu and pacing out our meal since we had limited real estate on our table.  It seemed like things came....we ate them....and as the next item was dropped, the only plate was taken.  Like beautiful, delicious clockwork.The 3 of us were recommended to get 6-7 items, so we each picked a few that everyone else agreed on and prepared ourselves.  Between food pace and quality, our server's attention and kindness, and the general awesome ambiance and atmosphere...this place was firing on all cylinders for us.  I cannot wait to come back here again.Below you will find the dishes we ordered if you care to know more about each dish.We ordered and received the following:Bone Marrow - A large bone full of marrow served with buttered Texas toast, cilantro, capers and sea salt.  This was pretty amazing, but to be honest...once you've had good bone marrow, you've had it all.  In my bone marrow indulgences, I've had good, and bad...but never amazing.Pork Belly - This is the second dish we received and was tied for the most impressive flavor wise.  The complaint I have here is the portion size.  While I know this is a tapas restaurant, it still seemed tiny in comparison to everything else we received.  I feel doubling the size of this dish would give it more value.  I still highly recommend ordering this however because the flavor was spectacular.Hummus Shakshouka - OK....this dish was a dud.  The menu described it beautifully and I thought we would actually get Shakshouka but it was pretty much de-constructed which is not how the menu described it.  We got an egg, some sauce and hummus.  Honestly, this dish was beyond not worth it and I'm surprised it is on the menu.  Do NOT waste your time/money on this.Burrata - This dish unfortunately also did not impress anyone.  Burrata is a soft mozzarella like cheese that is mixed with cream.  The presentation was BEAUTIFUL as they made it look like Cannoli but unfortunately it was bland and unimpressive. Two misses in a row, we were a little worried.Fried Chicken Marsala - Another phenomenal dish that sounds mediocre on paper, but is executed perfectly.  I'm not even sure how they accomplished the flavors honestly, but it was a perfectly fried piece of chicken, with dabs of mushroom sauce, and actual mushrooms.  It was seasoned to perfection and was my 2nd favorite item this night.Lamb Ribs - The family next to us, could not stop raving about this.  It did indeed look delicious so we ordered it.  WOW...thank you family that I don't know.  This was the correct choice and tied with the pork belly for most flavorful of the night.  This dish is a MUST when you come here.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - When this came out, we were in pain from all the food jammed into our bellies.  I don't think we gave this dish a fair shot in all honesty because everyone was so full.  The little bit I tried was very good, but I had to put the fork down...same goes for my two dinner companions.","8/17/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6InyxxWLYI0J9y4342o12Q","Ron R."
"One of the most popular destinations in Chicago and for very good reason.  The fiancé gave it her highest recommendation when I was in town for a conference and it turned out to be the best meal of the trip!My friend and I ordered a bunch of small plates and everything was derricious.  The roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette on the broccoli was addicting while the tenderness of the octopus and pow of the salsa verde blew me away.  The star was the lamb ribs though - insanely tender and doused in a sweet, savory sauce that left me tempted to order another plate...or two.Service was great despite the expectedly crazy crowd and line and the selection of Old World wines by the glass was plentiful.","1/7/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DICLJDdq0HpvOVYR5mB4gA","Eric F."
"3 years later since my unimpressed review, the bf and I visited Chicago this past weekend. Since he is a huge pork-fan, we thought we'd give The Purple Pig another try (and he could choose off the menu with more expertise as a true appreciator of pork).For lunch, we ordered the pork neck gravy and ricotta, the pork blade steak, and the roasted cauliflower. I HIGHLY recommend the first two for a great representation of what Purple Pig has to offer. The pork neck gravy tasted like pulled pork and was so rich and creamy with a great tomato base. The pork blade steak was to die for - the glaze on the pork was some rendition of nutty honey and was paired so well with a nduja. The updated 5-star is for these two dishes!The cauliflower had a great char on it but had two dashes of too much vinegar and became a little acidic mid-way in.We arrived at 12 pm on a weekday and there was no line (while if you come for dinner, there will most certainly be a line).","8/16/2016Updatedreview","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JoJY7SZNUUmTa5t-OG1pfA","Jenny P."

"Best tapas I have ever had hands down!!!!I have often tried to get into this place over the years but due to its Michigan Ave location and popularity, wait times are usually 2-3 hours and for those that know me understand that I do not wait more than 30 mins for dining. Me and my body decided that a random Wednesday night around 5pm was going to be the night we get in without waiting a long time. We went to the host and she told us the wait would maybe be around 45 mins...I figured I could do that. Lucky for us we really waited about 25-30 mins. We had some Estrella beer to tide us over during the wait. We were seated next to each other at a big ass table that featured many other patrons which was cool as we were just glad to get seated. Our server David, who was quite awesome came by and gave us the good recommendations from the menu. My buddy had been before so he had his own ideas. We went with the following:Pork Blade Steak with Nduja & honey - simply the best!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - Woooo! So damn good!Pork Belly Rillons - yum...very good!Duck Confit - Still thinking about that...sooo good!Housemade Morcilla Sausage, Poached Lobster Tail, Grilled Asparagus with Rhubarb & Spring Pea - Good stuff!David attempted to go over desert options but we were too full to even think about it...next time though.As you can tell, I enjoyed the hell out of the food @ Purple Pig!

"5 stars for food, 3 stars for service.My boyfriend and I came to Purple Pig around 1PM on a Monday. Although the restaurant was filled, we were seated immediately. I'm rating the service as 3 stars because the waitress didn't seem like she cared about our table. Because it is a tapas place, they usually switch out your place frequently so the flavors of the different plates do not overlap each other. Our plates were not switched once. Everyone was still amazing, but our waitress was way more attentive to other tables than ours.Moving on to the food. Everything was amazing!Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt Smear: We demolished this. The buttered Texas toast that comes with it pairs so nicely with the bone marrow and salad. We had to ask for more. The bone marrow itself was flavorful and fatty. The Sicilian Sea Salt added the perfect finishing touch.Charred Cauliflower with Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons, and Parsley: The Cauliflower had the perfect char, but if you're not a fan of vinegar, you might not like this dish. They go HAM with the vinegar, so you definitely have to balance this out with other dishes.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Picked Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: The pig's ear is fried into thin strips. They're really crispy and fatty. The fried egg helps soften it a little, with the runny yolk balancing out the fried deliciousness.Squid stuffed with Prosciutto and Breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and Carmoula: Don't be turned away because it's squid. They perfected the texture of the squid, and all the stuffing just makes the whole dish soo delicious! Don't be afraid to try this because it's squid. There's no fishy taste to this dish. I highly recommend!Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: So so so amazing. This dish is very creamy and flavorful. The pork shoulder is that really tender, melt in your mouth kinda pork.

"Bone marrow or bust! I have always been turned off by the idea of eating bone marrow, but this place definitely changed my tune! It's well-cooked, decadent, and extremely flavorful. There are also no frills to the dish; there is minimal seasoning and herbs...soo good! Also highly recommend the milk-braised pork shoulder; it's rich, tender, and extremely flavorful! This place is very difficult to get into; we went on a Sunday afternoon right after it opened, which made for easy seating. The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the wine; if you're a novice about choosing wine: lean on them for expertise. All in all great food and decent service; just come prepared to spend a little money for a great meal.","12/30/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dzbAnL-XttlCC4DaocD0xA","Lauren C."
"My first 5/5 star for a Chicago restaurant!  Purple Pig definitely live up to it's hype!  I totally though it was going to be another one of those places that's just ""good"" because people want to believe it's ""good"" after a 2 hour wait. I came here at around 11:00pm after landing Chicago and can't wait to try this place out. Dish 1: Grill octopus: hands down this is the best grill octopus I've ever had.  The octopus was grilled perfectly with seasalt.  It was toss with some green beans which give some crunch and texture to the dish.  The pesto lemon sauce have a fresh kick to the dish. Dish 2: Grill beef: wow, this beef was cooked medium rare without it being bloody.  The age beef was tender, delicious and melted in my mouth.  The creme cheese sauce gave it a flavor that you will not find anywhere else.Dish 3: Lobster Foie Gras Sausage: holy moly, the sausage melted in my mouth... ok that sounded a little wrong, but it did.  The skin casing was super tin that it's basically used just to hold the lobster meat and the foie gras together.  The funnel salad gave it a lightness and crunch to the dish, which adds a perfect texture to the dishDish 4: Pork shank: ok, I don't eat pork, but I had a taste of the flavor and the mash potato.  If you're a pork lover, this is a dish you must order. The flavor is an upscale version of the traditional pot roast.  The mash was extremely creme and makes you not want to stop eating!Dish 5: Nutella crepe: I was expecting a thin layer of crepe with nutella inside, but this beat it. 10 layer crepe with nutella in between each layer and a banana sorbet ice-creme.  How can you even beat that?  Nutty chocolate sauce with banana sorbet... yup, there's no other way to end the meal than this. Tip: come around 5:00pm (right when it opens) or after 10:30pm; otherwise, expect no less than a two hour wait.","12/18/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xRbBt5MVKZ5-_8HhhfI26g","Rosemary T."
"Thought this place served tapas-style and ordered wayyyy too many dishes for two people!! We realized in hindsight after reading some of the Yelp reviews that two people should get by fine with 3 dishes, well we ordered FIVE and I am slightly ashamed to say we devoured them all, some I guess more begrudgingly than others! Here is what we ordered:Calamari (5/5) - my favorite dish of the night. Very light and refreshing and loved its tartness Octopus (5/5) - this one was really delicious. Loved the green beans and potatoes in the dish.Fried pig ears (1/5) - real failure of the night. Cannot believe a dish could be overloaded with that much salt. The kale chips were just pure salt, I really can't believe this is one of the most popular items?? Milk braised pork shoulder (3/5) - really disappointing. Nothing special about this dish as it tasted like any other tender meat and gravy. The meat was slightly salty too.Pork chips with nduja and honey (4/5)  -not sure what nduja is to this day, but I would say the pork chops tasted awesome. There was some sweet chunky sauce to go with the meat which tasted similar to Korean gochujang paste, but I wasn't really a fan of its stickiness.This was an okay experience for me. The fried pig ears really killed my taste buds and made it hard for me to enjoy the dishes that came subsequently. My hubs and I didn't have to wait because we went at 4:30 pm on a Sunday, but if I had to wait I would have most likely given this place two stars.","8/10/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Njc3lo4M-T8w2bDFQB3c2Q","Jean R."
"You know you're starting to get old when you're looking for ""late night eats"" at 12:30 AM after watching a movie instead of 4 AM after a night at the bars. On the bright side though, there are a lot more options instead of just the usual greezy joints. After doing a quick Yelp search, it looked like Purple Pig was closing in 33 minutes. We figured they wouldn't be seating people anymore, but F it, it was worth a shot. To our surprise, we walked right in and got a table. Quite a difference from the 2 hour wait we're used to seeing here. Food: The service was a bit rushed, but understandably so since they were literally closing in 25 minutes haha. My goal was to not order anything that we already ordered the last time we were here, which was difficult since we damn near ordered the entire menu last time. Under pressure, we just shot from the hip and ordered some random items, which turned out to be great.Duck neck rillette - Last time we were here we ordered the turkey rillette, which was one of our favorite items. I'd say the duck rillette turned out to be just as good. I still don't know what the hell a rillette is, but picture a meat spread which a texture halfway between pate and shredded meat. It was salty and very dense, just delicious. When you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer. Throw a little strawberry mostarda on there too to add a little jam-like sweetness. I'm getting whatever neck rillette they have on the menu from now on. Smoked tongue - We were frantically looking through the menu to find something else to get, and our waiter suggested we try the tongue. Good call. The smoked tongue was delicious and a must try if you're a fan of salty meats. It reminded me of an Italian deli meat with a smokey twist. Each bite almost tasted like a cross between pepperoni and bacon. 2 for 2 so far with the dishes.Pork blade steak - When they brought this dish out, we were surprised at how big it was. This is probably the best value item on the menu. It looked like a super juicy pork chop served with a caesar style arugula salad. The steak was as good as it gets, hands down my favorite dish of the night. It was super juicy and tender, and something about the flavor just reminded me of breakfast. It had a distinct pepper taste, and almost tasted like breakfast sausage in steak form. Highly recommend this.Lamb ribs - This was the least favorite of the dishes. Maybe I just prefer pork over lamb. The texture was definitely there. The meat was falling off the bone and had a nice layer of fattiness. The sauce was just a little too sweet and overpowering for me. It was like a really bold barbecue sauce slathered all over the ribs. Overall, this was as gourmet as you can get for some late night grub. I'm glad we impulsively ordered without reading any descriptions because we discovered a couple gems on the menu.","8/6/2016Updatedreview","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA","Mike M."

"Worth the wait! If you're planning on a romantic quiet place, don't line up. If you're looking for good food and to make some friends, definitely get in line! Even before they open, there's already people hungry and waiting to eat. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations so don't bother calling ahead, just prepare at least 30+ mins of wait time. The servers are super friendly here. They have a very small kitchen for the huge amazingness that flows out of it. Go with what they recommend or dare to try something unique. There's plenty of options and something for everyone. The food here was so delicious, me and the BF came twice in one trip. Here's what we ordered:Pigs Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg - the most yummy thing we got. Break the egg, mix in the oozing runny yolk, then the softness of the egg blends perfectly with the crispyness of kale and pigs ear. The salty ear and the pickled peppers also compliment each other. Broccoli with roasted garlic & anchovy vinaigrette - never liked broccoli as much as now. It was crunchy with a light tang from the vinaigrette. Very refreshing and not overwhelming. Roasted Bone Marrow With Herbs - melts like butter. The scooped out marrow goes on top of a toasted brioche slice and add some greens to put a hint of bite. Wonderful. Pork Blade Steak with 'nduja & honey - tender and juicy. More on the sweet side than the savory. The orange mush that comes with it is a sausage based smear. So interesting. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes - this dish looks small but there's so much flavor and a lot of meat. Very dense. This was a bit too much for me but it was still tasty. The presentation was very cute. Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto & bread crumbs, Santorini Fava Puree & Charmoula - the BF loved this but I probably wouldn't order it again. It's an odd spiciness and the filling has crunch and squish to it. Brown Butter Panna Cotta - yes. Just yes. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet but not too tangy either. The sorbet mixed with the pudding-like delight is a great way to end the meal. The drip coffee they have is also very good so if you'd like a drink with the sweet, definitely grab a cup. The server was sweet enough to bring a second cup when we were low. Must try in Chicago!!","7/8/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VsKKGKX3pOiApq5SIZ-J8Q","Linda L."

Everything is delicious. No matter what you prefer , sea or land , it's all good. The best way to have an enjoyable experience is by dining with a group.

"Purple Pig was one of my must visit spots in Chicago, but my recent trip there was disappointing.  We decided to order something new instead of the usual dishes.  Maybe that was a mistake.  The pork neckbone gravy smears was decent in flavor, but it did not stand out from other meat based gravy smears.The pig ear was crunchy, but way too oily.  I almost gave up about half way.  The accompanied pickled pepper dominated the flavor.  I wasn't impressed.  Two stars for me.The beef tendon chip reminded of prawn cracker for those familiar with it.  The texture was crunchy as expected.  However, the flavored powder made my throat somewhat irritated. The vinegar taste was also overpowering.  This is another two stars.","1/7/2017Updatedreview","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TjlypHXquJGnRKzNEd4ysQ","Roger W."
"This is my second time at The Purple Pig and unfortunately, it will probably be my last. My friend and I managed to get in after a 30 minute wait, which really wasn't too bad. The restaurant was extremely crowded and inside, people were struggling to get around each other. We were seated outside which was nice since the weather was decent.We ordered the smoked pig tongue, bone marrow, and fried pig ears. To my surprise, there were only three pieces of pig tongue in the entire dish ($10). The flavor was extremely smoky and the texture was similar to that of jerky. This dish was a bit salty for my taste and left me gulping down my glass of water. If you are thinking about ordering the pig tongue, keep in mind that the portion is extremely small.The bone marrow dish is probably the most ordered dish at The Purple Pig. I enjoyed it the first time I came here but after ordering and eating it for the second time, I decided that the dish was a bit too oily for me. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what the bone marrow tastes like because I am unable to taste it. The only thing that the bone marrow added was more oil to the already oiled bread served with the dish. The salad had a certain sourness to it that was somewhat refreshing and cut through all of the other heavy, oiled flavors. Even though the bone marrow spread was extremely oily, it still tasted decently and the sea salt added a nice salty kick.The fried pig ears were unfortunately just too much fried-ness for me to handle. I am a huge fan of pig ears but I could barely taste them in this dish since they were so heavily breaded and fried. They simply tasted like giant fried breadcrumbs. The kale was perhaps my favorite part of this dish. It was lightly salted and so it tasted very similar to the seaweed sheets I loved to snack on when I was younger. The cherry peppers had a very strong sour flavor to them that overwhelmed the dish, making it difficult to finish.I appreciate that The Purple Pig has a large variety of dishes to choose from, but based on the ones I've tried, I can say that I am not a huge fan of this place.","7/5/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xdHM5YCDlHVFTPOPWESwMw","Karen Q."

My friends and I couldn't stop talking about their food the whole time we were in Chicago. We even contemplated coming back, even though there were several other restaurants that we could try in the city. The pork shoulder was so tender and flavorful. It practically melts in your mouth. It was combined with mashed potatoes which made it even tastier!I actually had bone marrow for the first time here, and it did not disappoint.

The waiter was very friendly and helpful.The Pig's ear with Crispy Kale had a really unique texture with a surprising amount of crunch. Combined with the pickled peppers and egg to make a fun mixture of different flavors.The Bone Marrow was good, too. But then again, when is a slab of fat smeared on buttered, toasted bread never not good? Regardless, I have to approve.Am I in a rush to go back?

"This is a Chicago staple. It's right on the Magnificent Mile, and it's god damn delicious. And reasonably priced! *sold*I've been here about 3 or 4 times, and have always loved the experience. Like most places in the area, they do not take resos. But feel free to add your name to the list, and then they will serve you cocktails as you wait on the patio. Their menu is expansive and rotates. But I usually start the meal with a satisfying cheese plate. Their dips are surprisingly largely portioned, accompanied with big pieces of buttery toast. But save room for their inventive dishes like fried pig's ear, sweetbreads, and house-made pasta with ground fish. Yes, those sound like totally random and possibly unappealing words but I assure you the dishes are packed with close-your-eyes-and-shake-your-head heavenly flavor. If you catch their meatballs on the menu, give those a shot too.

"This is in the center of Downtown Chicago with plenty of inside and outside seating that overlooks the surrounding streets and buildings. We came in the afternoon on a Tuesday and were seated right away. Since we weren't that hungry, we ordered the fried pig's ear and the Sicilian Iris. The pig's ear came with a lot of flavor. Get ready to feel full when ordering this one. The Sicilian Iris was both beautiful to look at and devour. When you cut into it, all the chocolate and ricotta inside oozes out and it's a very sweet and delicious dessert. I'd definitely come back to this restaurant to try their other foods.","7/6/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iumsoA6-_MR_XBIoFwMoUg","Evana L."
"First time visiting Chicago and chose The Purple Pig for our first meal in the city. We were pleasantly surprised as we had no idea it was Mediterranean style small plates. I loved that the menu has something for everyone, not only pork, as I initially thought. We ordered many items that were very different from items you can eat elsewhere. For example the Tuna Salad. VERY DIFFERENT from the tuna dishes served everywhere else. Very fresh, interesting combination with the potato, green beans, and quail egg. My faves and definitely must haves:1. Calamari 2. Tuna Salad3. Chorizo stuffed OlivesDidn't try anything with cheese, nor swine, but I can rest assured that they'll be just as amazing.

We tried a couple different cheeses and a sausage pate. Yum. Also we tried a pork shoulder which was really amazing. Service was perfect. Lunch crowd gets busy really quickly.

"If you're coming here on a weekend night be prepared to wait! The host quoted us a 60-90 minute wait on a Friday night around 6:30pm. It wasn't bad though because there's lots of shopping and a few bars nearby that help pass time. Around 7:45pm we got a text saying our table was ready and had 10 minutes to claim it. Once seated, our server came and offered a great wine selection. We ordered a total of four plates to share between two people. We started off with a Meat and Cheese plate (our server helped us choose two that paired well together - but I can't remember the names), which was AMAZING. Then we had the Calamari, which was on the lighter side but lacked a little flavor, and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - this was a little on the saltier side but it still melts in your mouth. Last but not least we had the Bone Marrow, which was the perfect balance of rich, buttery marrow, fresh cilantro, capers, and toasted bread. It was my first time having bone marrow because I was skeptical at first - but I'd definitely recommend it to any adventurous foodies out there!

"Tips: 1. You are going to wait 2. It's very loud. 3. Be ready to try everything!I tried to go there for lunch but we got turned around on GPS so we ended up walking right into it when sightseeing.  We put our name on the waitlist then went window shopping at the nearby Nordstroms. About 30 minutes later we walked back and was seated in about 2 minutes. Once we went inside, everything was mostly lip reading because it's freaking loud! Good thing the food is good and imaginative. We were seated in a cozy corner inside and it was obvious the Friday after work crowd had set in and were all not going anywhere. A good sign in a gastropub.I ended up ordering most of the food on the fried items menu... and no it's not your normal fried food. I had the Olives, Pig ears with egg and a deviled egg. yup thats thing. I was a bit disappointed the inside of the egg was not soft boiled but this was a FRIED deviled egg... not a fried soft boiled egg. Still delicious. The pig ears texture was more like bacon that anything else. The hubs hates eggs so I had to take it off before he would taste it. Im learning though that food combined are different than on its own.

We then got a text saying our table was almost ready. We were almost instantly seated.The restaurant is tapas style, which works like a family style restaurant where you order bunch of dishes to share, and dishes come out in no particular order. We ordered a bottle of red blend wine recommended by one of the wine specialist there. It was around $36, which was very affordable for us (3 poor college students haha).We ordered 3 dishes to go along with our wine: baked feta dish, fried pig ear, and the famous bone marrow. Im not much of a ""try exotic food"" person, but the bone marrow was too good  I def recommend it.All in all, I recommend Purple pig for a nice girls night out, dates, and just a nice outing to try great wine and beer!

"This place is amazing- so amazing, I came here twice in one week! The first time I came with my girlfriends and we sat at the chef's table. It was very cool to see how everything was prepared and the staff was great about explaining the dishes and giving us recommendations. And they are true experts! With all of our (probably) annoying questions about what they were making- they didn't skip a beat and ran that kitchen like a well oiled machine!1st time we ordered: bone marrow, lamb ribs, grilled octopus, broccoli, pear dessert. All was great. I felt like the broccoli was a tab heavy on the dressing, but the flavor was great (my other two friends highly disagreed, so who knows). My favorite dish was the lamb ribs- so unbelievably delicious!2nd time we ordered: whipped feta spread, chamomile pork steak, veal, chicken kebabs. Again, everything was great- but the chamomile pork steak was amazing. Definitely in my top 10 dishes of all time!If you haven't been, you must come! If you come between 6-9 you should expect to wait between 1-2 hrs, maybe more on the weekends. Trick of the trade- if you don't like waiting and don't mind having a late dinner come between 10-12. Place isn't insanely busy at that time, we had quick service, ate amazing food and had an easy walk to some great bars!The prices are on point for the serving sizes. 4 dishes for 3 people left us stuffed and we even had some leftover.My only disappointment is that I can't eat here everyday.","3/30/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=19Mw3M3_cl5UeNuwvR9kWg","Jaime B."

Crazy! They did give us the option of standing at communal tables in their heated patio. We swooped in when a couple left about ten minutes later. The food was expensive and really small. What one would expect from a rich, hipster joint. That was too bad, but not unexpected. Standing to eat while putting her bag and our coats on the floor sort of under the table was not cool. I don't know how one is supposed to eat there if they are backed up that much at 17:30, but it is what it is.  I won't be back simply because there are dozens of cheaper, better restaurants within walking distance that take reservations.","3/23/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pyFfrBzhSy-jErlvcoSDhQ","Nathan D."
"I just don't like this place as much as everyone else seems to. I really wanted to, but I just don't. At most, I think this place is okay. We ordered the pate, stuffed squid, gnocchi and turkey leg. Everything was pretty tasty, but a little too rich for my taste. I felt like some dishes were a tad too oily or salty. I would say that their pate is above average, and that's the one thing I recommend here. The stuffed squid was another favorite of mine but it was on the salty side. The food here did not leave a lasting impression on me. I don't know if I caught this place on an off day, but this is just based on my one experience here.Service here was decent. We were seated at a community table, which I am not a fan of, but usually okay with. The girl sitting the edge did not move down all the way so I ended up in a really tight spot. It was clear to everyone else at the table that I was uncomfortable. When I asked the waitress if she could remove the seat next to me so that I would have more room, she just move that seat over an inch and basically told me to deal with it....but nicely, of course.. There was no one sitting next me so I don't see the problem with taking the seat away, but luckily the girl on the edge finished her meal and the next person scooted all the way down. Maybe in the future, I'll like this place, but as for now, this is it.","11/26/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HlJ8GXKKi2gV2erAh6kC0A","Tiffany W."
"I also ventured this spot while I was here over the Halloween weekend. We came here on a late Friday late, so there was absolutely no wait. I just got off the plane, so I was ready to order everything on the menu. Let's see we got the pig ears with fried egg (I didn't like it that much. It was just fried crunch without much flavor), milk-braised pork shoulder (that was heavenly and the meat was so tender), bone marrow (it was buttery and so good with the carbs), scallops (they were cooked fine and weren't tough), and savory cannoli (I was really surprised by how it turned out. Def try it!). For dessert, we had apple pie which wasn't soggy and crumbly.","11/24/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZpTWRXQQTeAF5sp1r0A9IA","Jessica Y."
"My first time in the Windy City and I'm so glad I decided to try this place!! I came here on a Sunday around 5 pm and got seated immediately (lucky :D). The place is usually pretty packed so come early. But let me tell you, the food is worth the wait!! We ordered: -Milk braised pork shoulders with mashed potatoes (soooo good, the meat literally melts in your mouth) -""JLT"" Pork Jowl (the pork, tomato, fried duck egg combo works really well but the meat was a little salty for me) -Half duck with some kind of greek yogurt sauce (definitely for 3-4 people but it was so good my friend and I finished the whole thing ourselves. Sadly, I don't think it's on the current menu anymore) Overall, the food is amazing so try everything but be prepared for the wait, the tight seating, and the loud atmosphere :)","6/8/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aqTE8sslDppo2FGf-oWLQg","Christine Y."

"My first meal in the Windy City was this place. Luckily I was staying about 10 minutes from this place as it was difficult to get reservations to this place so I just showed up around 10:30 and luckily the place had room for us. Inside is very small, with a couple of booths and small tables and a long table inside. The patio area had more room for larger groups. The restrooms are clean and well-maintained. The dining area is pretty dim, but the decor around the place is pretty cool.Due to the portion of the plates, I recommend getting around 3-4 plates per 2 people. The one item I highly recommend is the bone marrow. The bone marrow also comes bread, sea salt and herb salad. This dish was my favorite dish here. The bone marrow just melts in your mouth, and the bread and the perfect amount of salt that I added just tingles the taste buds. My second favorite item there had to the calamari. The calamari also included some veggies, but the kicker was the pistachios, which I would never though compliment the calamari. The other items we got were the House Made Veal Mortadella Sausage and the Octopus. The Veal was alright and the Octopus too me was a bit too salty. Overall, I did enjoy the food here and was pretty full after finishing all the food.The service here was very good. We were seating very quickly and got our food and drinks in a timely fashion. The seating here is cozy, so expect to overhear other conversations. We were talking and sharing stories with people all the way from Florida. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at the Purple Pig, and I highly recommend it to those visiting Chicago. Its a good way to start off your stay here. 4.5 stars.","6/5/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Tdt1kIIJmkKMVo_1PZEkwQ","Jason P."
"Packed to the rafters, loud and 100% worth the wait. Arrived around 7pm on a Thursday to a packed house but luckily for us only a 15 minute wait. Seated a little quicker than that. Server was over quickly and very friendly. Clearly a professional server who knew how to help us where needed and when to stay back and let us enjoy. Solid wine list with 50 choices under $50 and a nice selection of cocktails/beer/spirits. The menu is ever changing, seasonal and locally sourced where possible. We started with a 5 cheese platter & bone marrow (can I give more than 5* for this? Incredible). Moved on to mains with a vegetable dish, meatballs, a hotdog and a flintstone-esque turkey leg. Each and every dish was flavourful, unique without being weird and filling. Large portions meant to be shared and passed around. Total for all this was $225 before tip. A steal at twice the price (and this would be twice the price in NYC....)Can't wait to get back.","3/6/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZKCHNmibYiDGzUmC-ojawA","Rob S."
"Great spot to have some tapas and drinks. It's always full of guests here, but I came for Saturday brunch around 1pm and got seated immediately. No reservations. By the time I had finished my meal there were a bunch of people waiting outside, with drinks of course so it's really not too bad. Outdoor seating is a must during the summer months and it's absolutely a fantastic experience to sit outside and soak up the gorgeous weather. I sat outside and loved it. Indoors struck me as being extremely loud (I stood inside waiting for the bathroom-only 2 stalls- and could barely hear my own thoughts). Come with a bunch of people as everything is tapas style and better enjoyed when shared. Order a little bit of everything from each section of their menu to get the full experience. We got the crispy pig ears with kale (I would have had no idea I was eating pig ears if I hadn't read the menu, try it!), a seafood dish (delicious sauce to dip bread in), the roasted bone marrow (so yum), and a roasted beet salad with a creamy goat cheese that was pretty perfect. I would definitely bring out of town guests here for a good time.","7/9/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YK49b7F2xzLjS9TruaaBtg","Wendy L."
"Purple Pig you were amazing!!! When my friends and I came to Chicago we were HIGHLY recommended to come here and we decided to go. It was a Friday night and when we got there in the evening they informed us it was about a 1.5 hour wait. I was extremely sad because I was getting hungry, but we decided to just leave our reservation and go walk around for a drink and some appetizers somewhere else. SO happy we did that! They text me once our table was ready so we walked on over and got seated quickly. We ordered several plates that i'm still salivating about. Just to give you an idea we ordered a calamari salad (fresh and tasty), bone marrow (WOW), roasted brussel sprouts, grilled octopus (a must), Pork Smear with Ricotta bread, and grilled tongue. Their dessert options are also amazing!Service was great! We also ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon that went well with our plates. Everything was so inexpensive which I'm not use to because a dinner like this in Los Angeles would be so much more. Extremely satisfied with this place and highly recommend it as well!!!","5/2/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LI4dc3hxvEWqLaTdjdzzpQ","Diana H."
"They don't take reservations. We waited about 45 minutes for a table for four on a Sunday evening. Not bad as I've heard the wait can be as long as 2 hours. This is a Tapas place so expect to get a call from your credit card company after dinner. But definitely worth your Christmas bonus. Here's why. The food is excellent and the dishes as unique. Portions are actually also very generous. We ordered about 7 dishes and 3 drinks. Our bill was around $200. The best dishes IMO were the Octopus, shredded fried pig ears, bone marrow and chicken skewers. The ham steak for 2 and gnocchi were okay.","11/26/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O9dJ38LAuj0dC7Pbaaq-5g","Annie D."

"This restaurant was on my must try list for my visit to Chicago. So glad that we were able to dine here on our last night without having to wait for a table. We were seated at a family style table so I often times found myself bumping elbows with my neighbors, but I didn't mind too much because the lamb ribs made up for it. If you order one thing here, make sure its the lamb!! The meat literally falls of all the bone. Its a perfect bite with a little bit of crunch, sweetness and tartness. Our waiter was helpful when we were trying to decide which bottle of wine we should order. The pigs ears were subpar. Make sure you get the pork liver pate, and don't be afraid to ask for more bread because the bread to spread ratio is a little off. If you aren't too full and have some room for dessert, the panna cotta should be at the top of your list!","1/30/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=L0R4WiPddx8KX6OEdZzx5Q","Marc S."

"We stumbled across this place while exploring Chicago's River Walk...we we're starving after a day of walking around DT Chicago...there was about a 1hr wait for a table in the late afternoon but absolutely worth it...the staff is really friendly and attentive throughout our stay...i love that its all tapas/small plates because its perfect for sharing allowing you to order and try multiple different dishes...everything we ordered was delicious and we practically cleared every single plate...definitely recommend the roasted beets, broccoli, bone marrow and chicken kebabs (so moist and juicy)...the most popular dessert is the Sicilian Iris which is killer...definitely a place we'll be frequenting when we're in the area...i'd say its not a good place for kids (especially those with strollers)...the family next to us had a baby and brought in a stroller which took up entirely too much space...as it is, the place is fairly small and really packed...","4/25/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9Fltiu7MMOcyG7tfX9i-Bg","Jes N."
"We were just walking along Michigan Ave and stumbled upon this place. It was about 1pm and it was very busy, we thought we'd have to wait but we were lucky enough to get seated right away! I recommend ordering the roasted bone marrow, pigs ears with crispy kale and the beets with goat cheese. Everything tastes so good, I can't wait to try other things on their menu next time. The prices are very reasonable, you would think from the quality of their food, that it would be more expensive. It's very loud and lively, it really does make you feel like you're in a big city!

"Walked in at 11:30 on a Thursday and Boyfriend and I were seated immediately. Tapas ordered: Whipped Feta with Avocado & Preserved Tomatoes Smear, Fried Smashed Potatoes, Deviled Egg with Arugula and Capers, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes and Chocolate Tahini CakeMy favorite was the smear, it was freaking AH-MAZING! I thought that all of the ingredients paired so well on top of the fresh, not overly toasted, bread!My least favorites were the deviled egg and cake. I love deviled eggs but I think that I was expecting something different for this dish, I definitely think that the capers brought it all together. And, the cake is one dish that I would not order again. All of the ingredients were layered and I think that the pomegranate was a bit overpowering to the chocolate. I left satisfied and to the point where I was comfortably stuffed.

"My one regret: that I came alone. The menu reads like a good book. Everything sounds delicious, and based on the things I tried, I'd imagine it tastes as it reads. I wanted to try almost everything, but given my practical side (I can't spend $200 on dinner just to try a bite of everything, can I?) I opted for the broccoli and the pork shoulder. The broccoli was a tad salty, but overall really well prepared. The garlic and slight acidity are my ideal flavor profile. Then the main course, the pork. Okay, moment of truth, the pork is good, but the potatoes are to.die.for... Seriously... When I come back I'm just asking for an order of potatoes so I can try other things on the menu.

"Didn't know what to expect after viewing the menu which is full of unique combinations of food I've never tried before, but everything we tried was a knockout. Chorizo stuffed olives: 3.5 stars. Least favorite dish of the day. Doesn't mean that they weren't good, I just wouldn't order them again.Broccoli: 5 stars. Best broccoli I've ever had, hands down. Anchovy vinaigrette is not fishy at all, so all you fish haters out there should have no fear.Calamari: 4.5 stars. Had no idea what fregola was but I liked it. Texture of fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios made this fun to eat. Nice to have calamari that's not fried for once.Milk braised pork shoulder: 5 stars. Pork shoulder is like butter, super tender. This is a creamy and rich dish that left me licking the plate. Skirt steak with mango: 5 stars. Usually don't prefer sauces with steak but sauce combo here was nice and fresh. Order the steak medium/rare.","6/12/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Jc4CdqYIm0NLxs9f_sMgeA","Drew A."
"There are lots of good restaurants in Chicago but what makes the Purple Pig one of my favorite places to visit is the convenient location and the rich variety of small plates that allow you to sample many of their dishes. I feel like a lot of places in downtown area are usually either too expensive or the food isn't anything special.That's not the case with the Purple pig. Their price is consistent with their food quality. Some of my favorite items to try were the roasted bone-marrow spread, pig ears with crispy kale topped with a fried egg, and milk-braised pork shoulders. . If you don't have a reservation, you can still dine at the covered and heated patio as long as you are willing to eat while standing !The menu is innovative and  it's definitely nice to know that such great quality and selection is available on the magnificent mile.","4/11/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B8oqqVpzi5iPvFdfbeI6ig","Halide T."
