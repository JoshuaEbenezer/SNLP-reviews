Long story short we left there and went to the Capital Grille. Excellent always consistent dining at the Grille. In my opinion I predict the Purple Pig will be a quick hit popular restaurant and will quickly lose its appeal as diners realize the staff is not about the customer or dining experience. Upon bringing to the waiter's attention we did not get all of our order/food his only response was \"oh sorry\", then quickly walked away. \"Oh sorry?\" I'm sorry too. I'm sorry he did not care more about his job and the overall success of the restaurant that employs him. As we sat at the Capital Grille still steaming of the overall horrible experience, 3 separate individuals said they have either had the same experience at the Purple Pig and will not return or they have heard other people experiencing the same thing.

They MUST have something to prove because I was so underwhelmed by my meal, I had to hit the Wal-greens around the corner to get some chocolate-covered pretzels after we left. I had high hopes for this place. A friend of a friend recommended it, and my friends and I had walked past it the day before \u00a0and thought that it looked like a fun place to check out. I have to assume that this friend of a friend is a frenemy. We got there around 4:00PM and it is slightly crowded and that's fine. We waited a few minutes and a waitress brought our drinks out to us. We were seated a short while later at a large table that they deal with family-style. This is fine. As long as you don't have a douche bag 25 year old sitting next you speaking so loudly that EVERYONE on the outside patio can hear. Honestly. Who says, \"I am going to commission a piece from the artist\"? Let me tell you who - this guy. We spent the next hour and 45 minutes listening to him talk over his companions, and the other 9 people seated at the table. I know that the restaurant cannot control this situation, but it just lends itself to our crappy experience. Here's what we ordered: Fried olives stuffed with chorizo - I didn't eat these, but the general concensus is that they were fine. Nothing to write home about. Or even to verbalize to the table. It's a fried olive. Fried eggplant with parmesan - They were OK. A gelatinous fried ball that tasted like cheese. Probably one of the better items from our list.Cheese plate - We had three cheeses: a chocolate goat cheese, a leceister cheese, and some gouda something or other. We didn't finish a single one of them. Seriously, I just needed a freaking Wheat Thin to eat with this. The buttered baguette was adequate, but not special.Pig heart sandwich, Chicago style - My friend ordered this and thought the pig heart tasted like roast beef. However, the sandwich itself was basically inedible. The bread was so hard that she couldn't eat it like a sandwich without cutting it. Here's my beef (or should I say \"pork\") with it: If you are serving me a freaking pig heart, make damn sure all the other pieces are good. Don't serve a rock hard loaf of bread with it. Because then, I am having to work my butt off to eat what many would think is offal. Seriously, the hotdog I had Mustard's Last Stand was a more appetizing choice than this.Chicken thigh kebabs - I know, I know... chicken thighs are fatty. But these were the fattiest, least savory chicken thighs I have ever sunk my teeth into. The best part of the entire meal, I kid you not, was the smashed and fried potato hanging out underneath the meat kebabs. The tziki sauce was fine. I've had better and I've had worse. Pineapple crusted pork something or other - Whatever this cut of meat was, it had a nice crust on it. Which was pretty much the only piece of the meat we could eat. As we dug through the meat, we found more fat and cartilege (bone???) than I would have thought possible. The guy next to me (not the DB, some other guy) had gotten it and eaten every bite. I have to ask myself... Did he eat ALL that fatty tissue and cartilge?? Did he??? If so, I am concerned for his health.So there's the rundown on the food. Now, on to the service. Which I think about as highly of as I do the food. Once we were seated my friend ordered the same drink that I already had in my hand. 20 - 30 minutes pass and no drink. Our waiter (who swapped with our original server) asked if there was anything we needed and my friend mentioned that she was still waiting on her drink. He became defensive and said it was at the bar. If it was at the bar, why not go ahead and bring it out? I made a joke about it and he wasn't impressed. I think if you are going to be in the service industry, you should know how to handle a joke. You are working with the public all day, every day.... deal with it! For these servers, it was a job. And you could tell. I've been to places where it's a profession and there's a noticeable distinction between those two roles. Our guy (and even the girl who we began with) are just there. Posers themselves. We spent the rest of our time at this restaurant waiting out the time so that we could go. I question anyone who swears by this place.

However I've never written a review. I thoroughly enjoy reading all of the entertaining insights on all of the places I've worked \u00a0my 14 years in this business. It helps me to gain new insight in my chosen profession as \"director of cuisine\". \u00a0Not only does Yelp humor me-it humbles me as well. Let me be clear that I am breaking my oath to keep silent- strictly based on a service perspective. I have dined at the Purple Pig enough times to safely say that I have tried almost each and every item on the menu- It is brilliant and undeniably delicious. I \u00a0wake up craving particular items- plan my day around \u00a0how I can somehow squeeze there deliciousness into my break from my double at work. Like an addict I care not of the repercussions. I compare my relationship to The Purple Pig to that of a sick love affair with a married man. I get the meat I crave but none of the true tenderness that builds a lasting relationship. The service is painfully pretentious and unapologetic in being so. Each and every time I remind myself before heading there, not to expect a smile or a thank you. Each and every time I prepare myself for the rolled eyes or blatant ignorance of my simple \u00a0requests. \u00a0All of those issues seem to just dissipate the moment those flavors and textures hit my lips. But I have to say-after today I don't know how much more abuse I can take. I pride myself in the work I do-with the relationships I form with my customers, and I seek solace in putting my pride aside at times when I know I'm wrong.

The service here was TERRIBLE. I have never experienced such horrible service in my life. The staff was also rude.Here's what happened: We showed up at 6:30 last night (a Thursday!), and the restaurant was packed. No worries, we expected that. The hostess told us that our party of four would be seated within a half hour, so we found a place at the bar and each had a glass of wine. A half hour rolls by, and I always get nervous about these things, so I went back up to the hostess and pointed out my boyfriend (who is very tall and noticeable) and said, that is Dave, who the reservation is under, we are standing at the bar right there, so that you can find us. She says, \"Great! You are next.\" So I settle back in at the bar. More time passes, and we are still waiting, so we decide to just go ahead and order the bottle of wine we planned to have with dinner and to start it at the bar. I get nervous again so I send over Dave to check on our status. Once again, he tells the hostess where we are standing and asks about the status. She says, \"a table is going to open up any minute. You are next.\" So we continue to be patient and keep drinking our wine at the bar. At one point, one of the hostesses comes over to us, and my boyfriend says, \"are you looking for Dave?\" and the hostess says, \"are you a party of 3?\" and Dave says \"No, we are a party of four.\" Yet another half hour passes, so we send someone over again. At this point, we are informed that we lost our table because quote unquote \"We could not find you.\" By then we are so frustrated and starved (and drunk) that we just leave. On the way out the door, one of the members of our party expresses our frustration to the manager, and the hostess says, \"Well we looked all over and could not find you. It is not my fault.\" I'm sorry, you couldnt find the 6'3 guy at the bar, 10 ft from the hostess stand, who we pointed out multiple times?

Ok so stuff happens, we ask the busboy if he can please take it back and get a new one or tell the server. \u00a0He comes back and lets us know the server would bring it out because she had to enter it into the computer? \u00a0Still no problem. A server other than our initial one approaches us and states that they are looking at changing the soda and will bring one out asap! Thanks for the follow up, although you were not the server who greeted me, took orders, made suggestions. \u00a0So our entrees come out. \u00a0I had the chicken kabob and my partner had the pork sandwich. \u00a0The sandwich was delicious I actually ended up eating more of that than my entree. \u00a0The kabob really was not that great of a presentation, it actually looked like a plate of slop because of the watery tzatsiki sauce, what appeared to be three potatoes and perhaps the juice or grease from the chicken combining together. \u00a0The chicken was ok, actually my partner liked my dish more and I his so we just swapped. In the meantime we really did not see anymore of our server until the end of the meal and the nice lady who came by earlier stopped by to see how things were. So at this point we tell her about the appetizer she was nice about it and apologized. They did end up taking it off the check. The place is cute, but the exhaust fans must not be working right or they turned them off later in the evening. \u00a0The place smelled like grease/smoky I could not wait to get out. \u00a0Perhaps they were cleaning the kitchen and had turned off the fans? \u00a0Whatever it \u00a0was I was grateful to go out for fresh air. Some suggestions for the servers if you are going to trade off a table, it is customary to let your table know that a new server will be taking care of them so we are not looking for you.

The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be there. In this friggin economy? Maybe if Avec, Blackbird, Bristol, Publican, and all the other restaurants that can deliver on both sides of the dining out experience. It is not enough to just offer great food at 100 bucks a head.

MOST of the seating is at \"community tables\" or whatever they call it, and you are literally sitting at one big table slammed right up against everyone else in other parties with zero separation or barrier. Most places that do this leave a gap of one chair or something, but I was literally brushing elbows the entire night with some random person next to me as if I was on an airplane, and it made it very difficult to have conversations because you heard people around you the entire time. We actually knew this ahead of time and specifically asked for a table, but we were seated at the community area anyway. Even the tables though have basically zero separation and many of them are in awkward places (i.e. right by the bathrooms or right in front of a door).b) The service was good and they cleared plates quickly, but there was a server who literally stared at me the entire time waiting to pickup plates as soon as I was done. It was kind of creepy and very awkward. I appreciate attentive quick service, but he was just standing there staring at me most of the time I was dining.c) All of the dishes tasted great, but a few were soaked in oil and way too salty.If this restaurant were to make a little more space, I would definitely go back and I think my experience would have been much more positive.", "review_date": "1/8/2017", "user_id": "5Uytpq7M8QSDPqdOpKZ9QA", "user_name ": "Karl S.", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating"}, {"review": "Food is ok but overprice by miles but I guess when you eat in Mag Mile thats what you pay for.

I absolutely love tapas/small plates restaurant, all the more reason to overeat delicious foods!My boyfriend and I got here at around 4:50 pm on a Sunday evening before a Second City Show, and there was no wait. We got seated at the end of a communal table. Our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and efficient. She came over and took our drink orders and then answered a couple of questions we had about the menu. We ordered The Pig Platter, the salt and vinegar fried beef tendon chips, the bone marrow, the octopus, and the pork jowl. The Pig Platter: I loved all the different meats and the pickled veggies it came with. The pickles were delicious and went so well with the meat. I loved it!Salt and Vinegar Fried Beef Tendon Chips: It was salty, fried goodness. My boyfriend LOVED it. It was good, but I also felt like I was gaining .5 lbs with every bite.Roasted Bone Marrow: One of my favorite dishes. It was prepared perfectly, and I loved the bread it came with. It was toasted, buttered, and too delicious. The greens that came with it was a great complement to the rich bone marrow. Octopus: When it first came out, it looked like sausage, but damn was it good. The pesto had great flavor, I was a huge fan. The potatoes and the green beans were delicious.Pork Jowl: Our favorite dish. The pork was tender, salty, and so good. We loved the sunny side egg on top, the runny yolk was a great sauce to the salty pork.Some of the dishes were a little heavy on the salt, but nothing the garnishes couldn't help with. Yum. We also decided on getting dessert (even though we didn't need it, but we were on vacation...) He got the affogato and I got the caramel poached pear dessert. We are huge desserts people. He loved the affogato (I'm not a coffee person at all), the poached pear was STUNNING. It looked gorgeous and tasted delicious. I definitely did not need to eat most of it, but that didn't stop me. I love the flavor of the poached pears, and the ice cream was a delicious nice touch.

Otherwise, *poof*, it's gone.FOOD: wowza. The octopus was actually the best grilled octopus I think I've had. Which isn't to imply that I am some sort of octopus connoisseur, but I've had my share and this is worth trying. The accompanying green beans are also very well seasoned in salsa verde.The pork shoulder was fall apart tender. It was served with a spoon and I nearly rolled my eyes at how ridiculous it would be to cut pork shoulder with a spoon. Well. They showed me. Accompanying mashed potatoes also amazing.The bone marrow set up was great. Very tender and flavorful. Definitely required a bit a strategy to remove, as bone marrow usually does. There was no cute way to do it. So if you are trying to be cute or polite, this might not be for you. The prosciutto crusted cobia was great as well. Crispy in all the right places, but what really took my heart was the sea beans. Wow.The cheese plate was awesome too.

Portion is perfect for sharing and the whipped goat cheese was plentiful. Just enough pistachio butter to add some weight to the airy cheese and tangy beets. Chorizo Stuffed Olives-6 olives atop some sour of sour cream. Nothing crazy here but if you enjoy olives worth the tasting. Chorizo is a teaspoons worth and breading very light. Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey- My favorite dish of the meal! Tender, perfectly cooked pork steak seasoned well and accompanied by an arugula salad and smear of ndula sausage. Very filling and perfect for 2 to share. We originally ordered another main but were informed after waiting a bit that the chef was unhappy with the result. We were comped any other dish on the house! We went with theChamomile Tea Smoked Pork Leg Steak for Two with Charred Cabbage, Sherry Membrillo & Pork Marrow Custard-Fabulous presentation of two great cuts of pork leg. The chamomile lent itself to the meat in a really interesting way in that it made the flavor of the pork stand out more. The charred cabbage was delicious I could have eaten it in a salad. The sherry Membrillo is a guava reduction and was tangy/sweet, a great compliment to the pork. The bone marrow custard came served in a bone cavity. This was good for spreading onto the meat and gave the leanness some weight. Caramel Poached Pears. Almond Genoa Bread, Pear Ice Cream & Chocolate Veil-Absolutely stunning presentation and flavors. The bread is an almond confection so moist and buttery.

During my third time here, we got some dishes outside of our usual go-to's (octopus, bone marrow) upon the waitress' recommendation. These included dishes like the smoked pork tongue and feta spread with date crackers (?). We ordered a couple more, but nothing comes to mind right now.Dishes were honestly mediocre and lacked flavor. The smoked pork tongue had potential to be good, but the temperature of the dish was odd--with its creamy texture, it was akin to butter that had been left out of the fridge for an hour. Lol. The octopus was also on the lackluster side, and consisted of more green beans than octopus itself. The only dish that remotely stood out in my opinion was the feta spread dish--it was pretty decadent, and the combination of flavors went well together.For some reason, every time I visit The Purple Pig, I end up getting seated at the long communal table with high chairs. I actually highly dislike it, as it provides little private space. Overall, the atmosphere within this restaurant is not to my taste as you have to yell (seriously) to talk to your friends.

A little bit much on the lemon for me, but I had no complaints. It was worth getting and the fingerling potatoes were a great touch. FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS.

Their meatballs, although highly recommended by the waiter and were indeed very fresh and juicy, were not that exceptional so I would suggest saving your stomach for something else. For dessert, we could've probably ordered something better because the poached pear with genoa cake that we got was pretty mediocre.

My biggest criticism would be that the service was too rushed - we kept getting asked if we were done with our dishes when we were still nibbling our way through the last few bites, or were just taking a break from eating.

MARVELOUS.\u00b6 Meyer lemon bar with olive oil sorbet ($9)This dessert was the perfect balance of flavor and texture: a tart lemon curd over a shortbread base and crispy rice pearls, with a subtle olive oil sorbet and light caramel drizzle. \u00a0Tangy and playful!\u00b6 Poached pears with amaretto cake, pear sorbet, & chocolate gel\u00e9e ($9)Easily the best-plated dish of the evening, the attention to detail was exemplary. \u00a0Pears poached in red wine along with a refreshing pear sorbet joined a wonderful amaretto cake and an unusual sheet of cocoa gelatin.Bread = 5+Circuses = 5Service wise, it really couldn't have been much better. \u00a0The level of attentiveness matched that of many Michelin places and despite not receiving any \"explanations\" of dishes, everyone from the guys who cleared the table to the girl who sat us were both polite and vigilant. \u00a0We never encountered a problem and water glasses rarely (if ever) got below halfway. \u00a0Pure professionalism.:VERDICT:Jimmy Bannos Jr and his staff of servers, hostesses and chefs absolutely SLAYED IT. \u00a0Every single person working here had a great upbeat attitude, although it was the kitchen whose stellar plate presentation and flawless execution of dishes left me stunned. \u00a0A legit dinner for two with drinks + tax + tip ran an even $200, but it was worth. every. penny.Without a doubt one of Chicago's best restaurants and the greatest meal I've had in many moons. \u00a0A superlative experience from top to bottom, I'll be recommending The Purple Pig to not just friends & relatives, I'll be preaching the good word to randos on the street......so if you see some crazy guy running up and down Michigan Ave shouting things about salted beets with whipped goat cheese & pistachio butter, pay him no heed......he just really, really likes TPP (and he thinks you will, too).", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "2/24/2017", "user_name": "Eric S."}, {"review": "Did I just not order what was popular here?The atmosphere was pretty cool.

I love the fregola (this dish actually got me into cooking with Israeli couscous) They dress it with something lemony, and honestly, I'm very partial to lemon so this dish was a win. The actual calamari is very well prepared, and very tender. 4/5FRIED ITEMS:Pigs ear - this is soo good. I'm used to carnita-style pig ears, which are chewy and yummy, but these are very krispy. They could've been anything fried, honestly. This dish is still flavorful, though, and enjoyable when eating. 4/5SMEARS:Roasted bone marrow - this is my favorite, and the reason why I keep coming back. The bread, the herb mix, the salt, the buttery bone marrow.. mmm. 5/5A La Plancha:Octopus - the octopus itself is tender and juicy, as well as the potatoes. But they give more potatoes than octopus so it leaves something to be desired. It's still good, though. 3.5/5OTHER:We've had this meatball type dish before with brioche. I don't see it online, or maybe I overlooked it. This was very mediocre. The menu stated the dish came with brioche. So my boyfriend and I were thinking at least one slice, right? Wrong. It was the tiniest disk in the world. What a rip off and huge disappointment that was. 2/5They've also had their play on ITALIAN BEEF. Now, come on, we're in Chicago. How cool is that? I was very hesitant about it, not gonna lie. Both my boyfriend and brother wanted it, though, so I went along. It was so freaking good! Too bad it was limited. They served some of the juiciest, most tender, most flavor-impactful beef I have ever had. 5/5DESSERT:Lemon Panna Cotta - pretty good bc I love lemon. Sometimes the texture is off. I love the crunch from the pistachios, though. 3.5/5Sicilian Iris - my boyfriend adores this dessert. I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, but he is and we both love brioche. This is good for maybe 4 bites and then it becomes too much for me. I think he'd give it five stars, though. 4/5Greek Donuts - I don't know what they're called and I don't see them online.

My approach? I was alone, sat at the bar, drank beer, ordered only two dishes, and spoke only with my waitress. Like I said, entirely all wrong.So, given my circumstances, why did this place feel so damn right?First, I credit the open-air kitchen. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations, so when I arrived to an overflowing scene, I figured it was a long shot. The hostess offered me an empty seat at a communal table, but even as someone who doesn't mind dining alone, I declined that out of fear of being some weirdo intruder alongside a large party of old friends. I then tried my luck at the back bar and was able to score a solo spot. Little did I know that this was front row to one of the most exciting, fast-paced kitchens I've ever seen. Watching the line cooks shout and prep and plate and joke, all in some unison form of communication was symphonic and aggressive and mesmerizing. I was enthralled by this uncanny form of theater, and would recommend you go enjoy the show if you happen to randomly find an opening back there like myself.Second, I credit the food. After a quick bit of research and consulting my waitress, I ordered the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder, as it seemed to be the most popular dish at the restaurant. Yes, the name at first gave me \"Always Sunny\" Milk Steak vibes, and yes, the plate itself looks like a fatty lump covered in gooey mush, but let me tell you, this is absolute pig heaven. Sitting on a pillow of mashed potatoes, drenched in gravy, and garnished with puffed farro, the pork is so tender, the side of your fork cuts through this like a blade. This is rave-worthy, mouth-watering stuff.This dish alone was probably enough for one person. But I sat there, marveling at the organized chaos behind the bar, immersed in the scene, thinking to myself, \"Am I really only going to order one thing? Am I really going to just up and leave right now?\" So I went for the Octopus, which arrived chopped and stacked in a pyramid of green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde. Our eight-legged friend is a pretty regular order for me in Mediterranean restaurants, but the treatment here at The Purple Pig was not your typical charred-tentacle-on-a-plate creation, but rather a tossing of said ingredients in a flavorful, land-meets-sea medley of sorts. Not to mention, I was able to shovel all of it down despite being full from the pork in the first place. I paired both with an easy-drinking Off Color Apex Predator saison (OK, maybe two), because... when in Chicago, ya know?Now, I would typically never take to the interwebs after sampling such a small percentage of a restaurant's menu, but the fact that these two dishes were so damn delicious gives me the rare vote of confidence that the rest of The Purple Pig's plates can only follow suit. If there's anyone willing to test the limits of this menu and prove out this theory with me, I'm game. Otherwise, I'll be in the back, at the bar, by myself, watching those cooks make magic happen in the kitchen.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sSveQQvgkDrPbpopNvbPSw", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "3/23/2017", "user_name": "Dan R."}, {"review": "Finally got to try this place out.

When people ask for Chicago recommendations, The Purple Pig is always on the top of my list. After these many years, it was good to gain affirmation of over a decade of support. This time I was enthralling by the Milk roasted Pork Shoulder served over the creamiest of mashed potatoes and deep fried farro. The Deviled Egg was a unique twist, stuffed and breaded, then fried.

Ambiance : Chilled Out, Bar Style, Casual. The Bar style is important as the place can get quite loud to the point you can't really hear your own partner if you've come here simply for its food. Service : As expected of a place like this although being that it was so heavily packed when we went in, it was impressive that there was ONLY a hint of tardiness between meals.Food : Ah the stuff that makes this place so famous. We tried the famous \"Roasted Bone Marrow\" for appetizer. The marrow was silky and oh so good! Shame it was too little though. They serve only half the bone so the portion is minuscule if you're going to share and will end up scraping it across your toasts. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the Mains, we tried the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Octopus with Green Beans.

The pork was cooked so perfectly that despite being stringy, it withered away with tenderness! And boy o boy that mashed potato was like butter! Combine them both and you were in pork heaven! Amazingly, for the other dish too my sentiments were almost similar. The Octopus was chunky and yet so tender and juicy it's worth applauding that the chef cooked it to perfection! And for the accompaniments, I don't usually crave greens with my meat, but those beans and potatoes were so well seasoned and pan fried that I couldn't stop eating them!!. A lot of superlatives going here but stay with me coz we now come to Dessert. As recommended by the server, we tried the Sicilian Iris. A warm and freshly made beignet stuffed with gooey goodness of ricotta and chocolate! I didn't know those two played so well before :).

We expected a long wait and were told over the phone that the wait could be 2-4 hours during the dinner hour so we decided to come at around 10pm to avoid the wait. We still had to wait for a table but we were given the option of ordering from the full menu and eating at the outside patio if we wanted. We decided to stand around a table outside and order from the menu (no seats but we didn't mind standing and eating since the table was tall). Eventually, by the time we figured out what to get, we did end up getting seated inside. Amongst my four friends, we ordered the Tom & Jerry steak, the turkey leg confit, and the pork shoulder. We later realized that it was a lot of meat for a late night meal. Everything was really good but because we chose all meat dishes, it did get a bit salty without some vegetables to balance it out. TOM & JERRY STEAK (Meant for at least 2 people)This was the most expensive item we ordered but because it was meant for at least two people, it's actually on par with the other individual entrees. There is bone marrow in the center that our server said you can spoon out and put on top of your meat like \"butter\". Steak overall was very good especially with the sauce. TURKEY LEG CONFIT WITH CRISPY LENTILS, NAPA CABBAGE, & AGRODOLCE I never thought I would like lentils but it gave a nice crunch and I found this dish balanced well when paired with the cabbage. The meat was tender and it came apart off the leg very easily. Since the turkey leg is so huge, I think you can easily share this dish with a friend. MILK BRAISED PORK SHOULDER WITH MASHED POTATOESThe pork shoulder was also quite tender but I think I enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy more as the gravy was delicious. I had the highest expectations for this dish since it seemed to be the most mentioned in the reviews but it actually fell short of my expectations. If you like pork and meat, then this restaurant is the place for you. Everything we tried was delicious and flavorful but it does verge on being too salty at certain bites. I wouldn't wait two hours for here but I would come back again at around the same time at night when the wait is way shorter and it is less crowded.

Super tender-braised pork shoulder - very soft and tender as well!Everything was delicious. Very interesting and strong flavors.

We were lucky enough to get seats at a long table right by the entrance, but the location did lead to some awkward and uncomfortable bumping as people entered and exited the restaurant. As far as food, we went with the roasted bone marrow (spread), the broccoli antipasti, the clam and cuttlefish brodetto, and the milk braised pork shoulder. Each was delicious and flavorful in its own way. The bone marrow was essentially meat butter and was a tasty spread for their perfectly toasted bread. Topped with some sea salt and salad, each bite was so well balanced in flavor and texture. The brodetto was served like a black pot pie and its cool appearance drew the attention of others sharing our table.The broth was terrific (although very hot, like magma hot), especially when soaked up by the octopus ink pita bread. My favorite dish was the tender and juicy pork shoulder, which was a much bigger portion than I expected. It should come as no surprise given the restaurant's name, but they do pork really well. My friend's favorite was the broccoli, which was crispy, fresh and loaded with roasted garlic flavor, then topped with toasted bread crumbs for an extra crunch.

It was drowning in anchovy vinaigrette though. Very salty.Roasted Bone Marrow (Smears) - My favorite dish! Very greasy but delicious. It comes with salt but I preferred it without.Housemade 'Nduja (Smears) - This was very strange. The bread had a layer of something sweet under the cheese, and the nduja (spreadable pork salumi) was very salty - I guess we should have put less but they gave us a lot. The giardiniera (pickled veggies) was pretty good, but it was just all a strange combination that did not go well together.Pig's Ear (Fried Items) - Nice presentation. TOO SALTY. The pig's ear pieces were fried to a crisp so you couldn't taste it at all. They were also sliced super thinly before frying so you don't get the actual texture of pig's ear either (I love eating the Chinese style of pig's ear salad). The crispy kale was delicious.Octopus with Green Beans - The octopus was really nice and tender. The taste of parsley was too overpowering though.

I finally got to go for dinner and I need to go back soon to try everything else on the menu.I went on a Monday evening around 6:30 pm and we got seated right away (just 2 people). There were a few tables available and some seats at the high tops but by 7:30 it was pretty packed. Everything on the menu are served as small plates and I think it's great to share so you can try a little bit of everything. Each person could prob order 2 things at least and you'll leave satisfied and full. The service was also excellent. The waiters were very attentive and food came out at a good time. They also were really good and spot on with their recommendations. We started out with cocktails, the sun n done and nick n liz. Both were really well crafted cocktails just depends if you prefer vodka or bourbon. We had the swordfish checkerboard crudo; the fish had a very subtle taste so you were able to taste everything that was placed on it, I can't even remember all the stuff on it but it worked. The bone marrow was one of my favorite dishes we ordered. The portion was big and it can definitely fill you if you don't share. Another dish we ordered was the fried pig ears and crispy kale. It was topped with a fried egg and you just cracked the yolk and mixed it all together, you can't go wrong with that. My absolute favorite dish was the lamb ribs with Israeli couscous and pomegranates. The ribs fell off the bone and the sauce was the best thing ever. As if we just didn't have the best meal ever we wanted to try the dessert. So we got the sticky date cake and the panna cotta. The sticky date cake with the orange frozen yogurt and pistachio butter sauce is an absolute to die for dessert. Overall one of the best meals I've had and I think for the quality of the food and the portions this place isn't pricey at all. There's a lot of options on the menu and everything looks unique and different so I definitely can't wait to go back and try some new things.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=s-kmSDkixx6Vw_n7hmMPsw", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "1/31/2017", "user_name": "Jessica P."}, {"review": "Wow. WOWwowwow!!I bookmarked the Purple Pig on a whim when searching online for potential dining places close-ish to the Theatre we would be going to and the Museum we would be visiting beforehand.

We weren't there more than 30 minutes after they opened, but they were already almost full! It helped that there were only two of us...It is very close inside. Tight aisles, very narrow ways between tables. If you aren't at a bar table, butts will be in your face. But you know what....it was ok. They are in A1 prime real estate, so I get making use of every single inch of space.I was a little confused about who our server was at first. Water was brought by one person, a menu and inquiry about a drink order from another. And then the third and final server came by to take our orders.The food...was really wonderful! We shared four dishes: the Bobota \"Greek cornbread\", the brussels sprouts, the hummus and the chorizo panini.The food came out surprisingly quickly, especially considering how busy the kitchen must constantly be and how packed the place is. The same can't be said for other tapas places I have been to (*coughArtesanoInLouisvillecough*) And that food....absolutely delicious! I love all brussels sprouts and these might be my favorite I've had! Teach me your waaaays! I wish i could have spent all day there, eating everything on the menu...but schedules and and my wallet said no.All said though, with tip, we paid about $50.

We ordered a flywheel, roasted bone marrow, milk braised pork shoulder, lamb ribs, beef tenderloin, and affogato. Unfortunately, we were served two of the better dishes before the other two and were slightly disappointed by the latter. But the simple dessert was a nice wrap up. The roasted bone marrow was served first and was delicious! The server also briefly taught us how to eat it properly when he served it to us. The acidity from the salad, the sea salt and the smooth fatty bone marrow on top of a nicely toasted toast is a combo that keeps you wanting for more. Next, we were served the beef tenderloin which came with something like a fancier beef patty. The star of this dish is really the beef tenderloin with the sauce around the plate. I have never had such tender beef. The milk braised pork shoulder is covered in a light coat of gravy and served on top of very light and fluffy mash potatoes. While I love the flavors of the gravy, pork and mash potatoes, there was just too much pork for two to enjoy. Regardless, the pork itself was cooked to perfection yet again and it easily fell apart in my mouth. The last dish was the lamb ribs. The ribs were covered in too much of the smoky sauce, which was too strong of a taste for my liking. Again, the lamb meat itself tasted delicious; it was cooked perfectly and slid right off the bone. To finish the dinner, we ordered the affogato dessert which is vanilla bean gelato with a shot of espresso. It was a delightful, light dessert. The service here is impeccable. The multiple servers really made sure we enjoyed our meal entirely.

With so many great restaurants here in Chicago, we both have always avoided this place due to the fact that there is usually a long wait because of their \"no reservations\" policy. Yet, we decided that a Monday night a 6pm couldn't be THAT busy. We were partially correct about this. Although we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, the restaurant was definitely still packed to the brim throughout our dining experience. Pro-tip: If you have only two people, you will have a MUCH shorter wait than if you have 4 or more people.The food for the most part was pretty good, especially the Pigs Ears and surprisingly enough, the Caramelized Carrots. However, my biggest gripe was how SALTY certain dishes were. The main perpetrator of this was the Octopus, which was accompanied with green beans and potatoes and was covered in a Salsa Verde. However, rather than let the flavors of the Octopus and Salsa come through, the only flavor I got was \"salt\". We politely let the waiter know and he brought us a second dish that was MUCH better, so definite plus for customer service -- just not a fan that I had to ask for something to be taken back at a semi-upscale restaurant. If I had friends come in town and want to eat there, I would first check the calendar and time to make sure it was not a Saturday at 7pm and would probably go back because it was pretty good food.

My friend and I were just walking around Chicago when I noticed we were walking past this place around 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. It was pretty crowded during lunchtime, and I heard of the long waits here, so we made a quick pitstop as this was perfect timing. We had no wait and were seated at one of the high-top communal tables, though I wish we sat at the bar area where you can see the chefs prepare everything. I've never had bone marrow before so I was all for ordering it after taking a quick peek at all the Yelp tips, and we also got the pork shoulder. We split the two appetizers and a couple of drinks and that was more than enough. Keep in mind, we had just eaten a full meal so I wasn't hungry at all! I finished everything that was left as my friend tapped out from the flavor and density of the bone marrow and pork shoulder. The bone marrow came out topped with this cilantro and onion mix that was tossed in some kind of oil (or maybe even the marrow juices), with some salt on the side, perfectly toasted and buttered bread, and the humongous bone that was the star of the show. The kind server instructed us to spread the marrow on the bread, toss some of the cilantro mix on top, and sprinkle some salt. My skin pricked right up on my first bite and I got the shivers, it was that good! I normally hate cilantro, but everything just went great together.The pork shoulder was also amazing, and just melted in my mouth. There was this cheesy mashed potato on the bottom and drizzled on top of the shoulder that put this over the top.This might've been my favorite meal I had in Chicago, and it was totally spur of the moment (my favorite)! I really can't recommend this place more, even the service was top notch.

Surprising the pig ear was very crunch but was very addicting! I could not stop eating. Just when I didn't think it could get any better, the bone marrow came. It's a very unique dish where you scrape off the bone marrow from the bone and put it onto the bread. I'm not a huge lamb fan, but decided to try it based off of the reviews on Yelp. It surprised me!

Period. Be warned they do not take reservations and this place is very very popular so if you come anytime close to dinner you will surely have a wait before being seated and I can only imagine waits get very long on weekends.I came here for a late dinner on a tuesday night after getting out of a show at Second City. It was a little after 10 PM when I arrived and though I was seated immediately after walking in the place was still very busy. The best way to describe Purple Pig is a smaller and somewhat cheaper version of Girl & the Goat. You have to be a bit adventurous if you plan on dining here otherwise this restaurant is really not for you. The menu here is a bit exotic and as the waitress put it the name of the game is to try as many little plates as possible until you are filled up.I started my meal off with the calamari, fregola, radishes, cucumbers, and pistachios dish. This dish was a good start but it just didn't pack the out of this world flavor I was expecting. For my second course at my waitress's recommendation I went with the lamb ribs with harissa, treviso marmalade, Isreali couscous, and orange. Now this dish definitely had that out of this world flavor I was searching for. I quickly added it to my list of top five greatest things I've ever eaten. According to the waitress that is their most popular dish. To finish my meal I went with the squid stuffed with prosciutto and bread crumbs with santorini fava puree and charmoula. This dish was excellent and very flavorful as well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Service is great here. All of the dishes came out pretty fast. The setting is a bit crowded and you are in relatively close quarters to the tables adjacent to you.

We were already on the Mag Mile, so I wanted to choose a place that was within walking distance. The Purple Pig is located near the south end of the Mag Mile, a few blocks north of the river.This is a modern, happening tapas (small plates) restaurant with a bar, covered patio, and open kitchen. The restaurant isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. It's popular - at the time of writing this review, it's already got 4,581 reviews (!) - and it was packed during our Sunday afternoon visit around 1pm. They *do not* take reservations. It's first come, first served. We were lucky and were seated immediately at one of the communal high-tops near the kitchen.As with any tapas restaurant, the dishes here are best shared. I asked our server, Andi, to give us her recommendations and she starred all the popular and most suggested items on the menu. This list should give you a good idea of the restaurant's offerings as well as pricing:Antipasti:* Broccoli with roasted garlic, toasted breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette ($8)* Calamari with fregola, radishes, cucumbers, & pistachios ($10)* Charred cauliflower with toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons, and parsley ($9)* Salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette ($9)Smears:* Roasted bone marrow with herb salad and Sicilian sea salt ($14)Fried Items:* Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and fried egg ($10)A La Plancha, Etc.* Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde ($16)* Turkey leg confit with crispy lentils, napa cabbage, and agrodolce ($17)* Pork blade steak with 'nduja and honey ($17)* Squid stuffed with prosciutto and breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and charmoula ($15)* Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes ($13)From the above recommendations, we ended up going with the broccoli, calamari, pig's ear, and octopus. In addition, we also ordered:* Chicken thigh kebabs with fried smashed potatoes and tzatziki ($14)In general, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either. I can't say I had a favorite. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and flavorful enough (for the most part).The anchovy vinaigrette made the broccoli a bit salty.The calamari wasn't as my friends expected (fried calamari). Instead, the calamari was more like a cold pasta dish with lots of fregola (small pasta balls, similar to couscous) and thin, tart, vinegary radish and cucumber slices. Out of the dishes we ordered, we left the most of this one behind.The strips of pig's ear were hard and crispy (kind of like chips). I think our table was in agreement that the ear strips were kinda bland. The fried egg on top was a nice touch though.There really wasn't enough octopus to go around in the octopus dish. What little there was was good, however. Thick and flavorful.If I had to pick a favorite, it'd be the chicken thigh kebabs. The tender chicken and filling potatoes were simple, tasty, and comforting.Andi did an excellent job taking care of us. Dishes came out from the kitchen as they were ready, instead of all out at once (Andi asked us what we preferred and we chose the former). A Purple Pig branded glass bottle of water was left at our table so we didn't need to wait for refills on water. All of the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly.There are only two single-stall restrooms and there was always a line for the restrooms throughout the entire duration of our visit.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review_date": "9/8/2016", "user_name": "Daniel B."}, {"review": "We came at 5PM on a Sunday and there was no wait.

We got to the Purple Pig around 9:30pm and we were seated immediately. Luckily, we still had a good appetite for this fantastic restaurant. We were kindly greeted by our attentive waiter and he gave us remarkable suggestions about what dishes to order. As a result, we ordered the milk braised pork shoulder and the fried pig ear. The milk braised pork shoulder was heavenly and literally melted in your mouth because the meat was extremely tender and soft. This dish was such a good value too because the portion size was large enough to split between two people and it came with a good amount of creamy mashed potatoes. If you come to Purple Pig you have to order the pork shoulder, it's definitely one of the best dishes that they have! Unfortunately, the fried pig ear with crispy kale was a bit underwhelming. The small fried strips of pig ear did not really taste flavorful and it seemed as though you were just eating fried bits of dough. However, the dish did come with a perfectly cooked fried egg and the kale was flavorful and crunchy. Overall, the fried pig ear could use some improvement in perfecting the flavor of the pig ear, but this dish is definitely a good value.

Was seated immediately but still surprised to see the place half full. The food here was really amazing and is deserving of a 5 star rating. The antipasti we ordered, Broccoli with Roasted Garlic, Toasted Breadcrumbs, and Anchovy Vinaigrette, was the best broccoli I've ever had in my life. We also had the Fava Bean Smear, Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Picked Cherry Peppers, and Fried Egg (amazing, esp when the yolk broke), and the lamb with couscous and pomegranate (flavors were too intense but good nonetheless). After trying the food here, I questioned why Purple Pig only had 4 stars.Based off of my experience, Purple Pig gets a 4 instead of a 5 because of the obnoxious waitress we had. It was raining when we went to Purple Pig, so my bf let me wear his rain boots. They were too large for me so when I got new ones and gave them back to him, he put them on the wrong foot. The first thing our waitress said to us as soon as we were seated was, \"JUST SO YOU KNOW YOUR SHOES ARE ON BACKWARDS\" (caps to exemplify her loud tone). That could have been whispered. Secondly, I ordered a glass of sparkling wine with my lunch and the waitress asked to see my ID but didn't do so for the other person in my party. I think it goes w/o saying that if you card one person in the party, you need to card the whole party. But on top of that, as I was reaching for my ID, she surmised, \"HMM YOU MUST BE A '94.... OH YOU'RE A '95, THE 21 CLUB!\" (again, caps to exemplify loud tone).. Like, thank you for announcing my age to the restaurant. When it was my bf's turn to order a drink, he wanted a pinot noir.. the waitress' response was \"No, why don't you have this instead\". Going with the flow, my bf said sure, but didn't like her recommendation so sent it back. She then brought out another red w/o consulting him about what it was going to be (and he didn't like that choice either). She also said \"you must not have a lot of red experience\"... (IRL my bf actually refuses to drink anything but red). We switched staff in the middle of the meal and the second waiter was a lot more calm.

Next, the bone marrow with a parsley & caper salad with bread. The bone marrow had GREAT flavor and the bread was delicious. Also on the bread side (we love it can't you tell??), salt cured Greek yogurt with an apple-pistachio compote. It had almost the taste of goat cheese and the compote was sweet and tangy. Keeping with the carb theme, homemade potato tots (\"patatas bravas\") with a Harissa sauce and some other sauce. They were tangy and delicious. For veggies, we had the broccoli with roasted garlic, breadcrumbs, and anchovy vinaigrette. This dish was DELICIOUS. Super savory and tangy. It was my friend's favorite dish of the night. I absolutely loved it, too. My favorite dish of the night was roast chicken thigh kebabs with roasted smashed potatoes on the most amazing tzatziki I've ever had. This was seriously so good.

Two misses in a row, we were a little worried.Fried Chicken Marsala - Another phenomenal dish that sounds mediocre on paper, but is executed perfectly. \u00a0I'm not even sure how they accomplished the flavors honestly, but it was a perfectly fried piece of chicken, with dabs of mushroom sauce, and actual mushrooms. \u00a0It was seasoned to perfection and was my 2nd favorite item this night.Lamb Ribs - The family next to us, could not stop raving about this. \u00a0It did indeed look delicious so we ordered it. \u00a0WOW...thank you family that I don't know. \u00a0This was the correct choice and tied with the pork belly for most flavorful of the night. \u00a0This dish is a MUST when you come here.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder - When this came out, we were in pain from all the food jammed into our bellies. \u00a0I don't think we gave this dish a fair shot in all honesty because everyone was so full. \u00a0The little bit I tried was very good, but I had to put the fork down...same goes for my two dinner companions.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6InyxxWLYI0J9y4342o12Q", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "8/17/2016", "user_name": "Ron R."}, {"review": "One of the most popular destinations in Chicago and for very good reason. \u00a0The fianc\u00e9 gave it her highest recommendation when I was in town for a conference and it turned out to be the best meal of the trip!My friend and I ordered a bunch of small plates and everything was derricious. \u00a0The roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette on the broccoli was addicting while the tenderness of the octopus and pow of the salsa verde blew me away. \u00a0The star was the lamb ribs though - insanely tender and doused in a sweet, savory sauce that left me tempted to order another plate...or two.Service was great despite the expectedly crazy crowd and line and the selection of Old World wines by the glass was plentiful.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DICLJDdq0HpvOVYR5mB4gA", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "1/7/2017", "user_name": "Eric F."}, {"review": "3 years later since my unimpressed review, the bf and I visited Chicago this past weekend.

Although the restaurant was filled, we were seated immediately. I'm rating the service as 3 stars because the waitress didn't seem like she cared about our table. Because it is a tapas place, they usually switch out your place frequently so the flavors of the different plates do not overlap each other. Our plates were not switched once. Everyone was still amazing, but our waitress was way more attentive to other tables than ours.Moving on to the food. Everything was amazing!Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt Smear: We demolished this. The buttered Texas toast that comes with it pairs so nicely with the bone marrow and salad. We had to ask for more. The bone marrow itself was flavorful and fatty. The Sicilian Sea Salt added the perfect finishing touch.Charred Cauliflower with Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons, and Parsley: The Cauliflower had the perfect char, but if you're not a fan of vinegar, you might not like this dish. They go HAM with the vinegar, so you definitely have to balance this out with other dishes.Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Picked Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg: The pig's ear is fried into thin strips. They're really crispy and fatty. The fried egg helps soften it a little, with the runny yolk balancing out the fried deliciousness.Squid stuffed with Prosciutto and Breadcrumbs, Santorini fava puree, and Carmoula: Don't be turned away because it's squid.

Dish 1: Grill octopus: hands down this is the best grill octopus I've ever had. \u00a0The octopus was grilled perfectly with seasalt. \u00a0It was toss with some green beans which give some crunch and texture to the dish. \u00a0The pesto lemon sauce have a fresh kick to the dish. Dish 2: Grill beef: wow, this beef was cooked medium rare without it being bloody. \u00a0The age beef was tender, delicious and melted in my mouth. \u00a0The creme cheese sauce gave it a flavor that you will not find anywhere else.Dish 3: Lobster Foie Gras Sausage: holy moly, the sausage melted in my mouth... ok that sounded a little wrong, but it did. \u00a0The skin casing was super tin that it's basically used just to hold the lobster meat and the foie gras together. \u00a0The funnel salad gave it a lightness and crunch to the dish, which adds a perfect texture to the dishDish 4: Pork shank: ok, I don't eat pork, but I had a taste of the flavor and the mash potato. \u00a0If you're a pork lover, this is a dish you must order. The flavor is an upscale version of the traditional pot roast. \u00a0The mash was extremely creme and makes you not want to stop eating!Dish 5: Nutella crepe: I was expecting a thin layer of crepe with nutella inside, but this beat it. 10 layer crepe with nutella in between each layer and a banana sorbet ice-creme. \u00a0How can you even beat that? \u00a0Nutty chocolate sauce with banana sorbet... yup, there's no other way to end the meal than this.

We realized in hindsight after reading some of the Yelp reviews that two people should get by fine with 3 dishes, well we ordered FIVE and I am slightly ashamed to say we devoured them all, some I guess more begrudgingly than others! Here is what we ordered:Calamari (5/5) - my favorite dish of the night. Very light and refreshing and loved its tartness Octopus (5/5) - this one was really delicious. Loved the green beans and potatoes in the dish.Fried pig ears (1/5) - real failure of the night. Cannot believe a dish could be overloaded with that much salt. The kale chips were just pure salt, I really can't believe this is one of the most popular items?? Milk braised pork shoulder (3/5) - really disappointing. Nothing special about this dish as it tasted like any other tender meat and gravy. The meat was slightly salty too.Pork chips with nduja and honey (4/5) \u00a0-not sure what nduja is to this day, but I would say the pork chops tasted awesome. There was some sweet chunky sauce to go with the meat which tasted similar to Korean gochujang paste, but I wasn't really a fan of its stickiness.This was an okay experience for me. The fried pig ears really killed my taste buds and made it hard for me to enjoy the dishes that came subsequently. My hubs and I didn't have to wait because we went at 4:30 pm on a Sunday, but if I had to wait I would have most likely given this place two stars.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Njc3lo4M-T8w2bDFQB3c2Q", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review_date": "8/10/2016", "user_name": "Jean R."}, {"review": "You know you're starting to get old when you're looking for \"late night eats\" at 12:30 AM after watching a movie instead of 4 AM after a night at the bars. On the bright side though, there are a lot more options instead of just the usual greezy joints. After doing a quick Yelp search, it looked like Purple Pig was closing in 33 minutes. We figured they wouldn't be seating people anymore, but F it, it was worth a shot. To our surprise, we walked right in and got a table. Quite a difference from the 2 hour wait we're used to seeing here. Food: The service was a bit rushed, but understandably so since they were literally closing in 25 minutes haha. My goal was to not order anything that we already ordered the last time we were here, which was difficult since we damn near ordered the entire menu last time. Under pressure, we just shot from the hip and ordered some random items, which turned out to be great.Duck neck rillette - Last time we were here we ordered the turkey rillette, which was one of our favorite items. I'd say the duck rillette turned out to be just as good. I still don't know what the hell a rillette is, but picture a meat spread which a texture halfway between pate and shredded meat. It was salty and very dense, just delicious. When you spread it on the toast it cuts some of the saltiness and is just a great appetizer. Throw a little strawberry mostarda on there too to add a little jam-like sweetness. I'm getting whatever neck rillette they have on the menu from now on. Smoked tongue - We were frantically looking through the menu to find something else to get, and our waiter suggested we try the tongue. Good call. The smoked tongue was delicious and a must try if you're a fan of salty meats. It reminded me of an Italian deli meat with a smokey twist. Each bite almost tasted like a cross between pepperoni and bacon. 2 for 2 so far with the dishes.Pork blade steak - When they brought this dish out, we were surprised at how big it was. This is probably the best value item on the menu. It looked like a super juicy pork chop served with a caesar style arugula salad. The steak was as good as it gets, hands down my favorite dish of the night. It was super juicy and tender, and something about the flavor just reminded me of breakfast. It had a distinct pepper taste, and almost tasted like breakfast sausage in steak form. Highly recommend this.Lamb ribs - This was the least favorite of the dishes. Maybe I just prefer pork over lamb. The texture was definitely there. The meat was falling off the bone and had a nice layer of fattiness. The sauce was just a little too sweet and overpowering for me. It was like a really bold barbecue sauce slathered all over the ribs. Overall, this was as gourmet as you can get for some late night grub. I'm glad we impulsively ordered without reading any descriptions because we discovered a couple gems on the menu.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=W2zno-nXaGa9Y2Au7L8wNA", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review_date": "8/6/2016Updatedreview", "user_name": "Mike M."}, {"review": "Food was great and the wine was excellent.

If you're planning on a romantic quiet place, don't line up. If you're looking for good food and to make some friends, definitely get in line! Even before they open, there's already people hungry and waiting to eat. The Purple Pig doesn't take reservations so don't bother calling ahead, just prepare at least 30+ mins of wait time. The servers are super friendly here. They have a very small kitchen for the huge amazingness that flows out of it. Go with what they recommend or dare to try something unique. There's plenty of options and something for everyone. The food here was so delicious, me and the BF came twice in one trip. Here's what we ordered:Pigs Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg - the most yummy thing we got. Break the egg, mix in the oozing runny yolk, then the softness of the egg blends perfectly with the crispyness of kale and pigs ear. The salty ear and the pickled peppers also compliment each other. Broccoli with roasted garlic & anchovy vinaigrette - never liked broccoli as much as now. It was crunchy with a light tang from the vinaigrette. Very refreshing and not overwhelming. Roasted Bone Marrow With Herbs - melts like butter. The scooped out marrow goes on top of a toasted brioche slice and add some greens to put a hint of bite. Wonderful. Pork Blade Steak with 'nduja & honey - tender and juicy. More on the sweet side than the savory. The orange mush that comes with it is a sausage based smear. So interesting. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes - this dish looks small but there's so much flavor and a lot of meat. Very dense. This was a bit too much for me but it was still tasty. The presentation was very cute. Squid Stuffed with Prosciutto & bread crumbs, Santorini Fava Puree & Charmoula - the BF loved this but I probably wouldn't order it again. It's an odd spiciness and the filling has crunch and squish to it. Brown Butter Panna Cotta - yes. Just yes. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet but not too tangy either. The sorbet mixed with the pudding-like delight is a great way to end the meal. The drip coffee they have is also very good so if you'd like a drink with the sweet, definitely grab a cup.

My friend and I managed to get in after a 30 minute wait, which really wasn't too bad. The restaurant was extremely crowded and inside, people were struggling to get around each other. We were seated outside which was nice since the weather was decent.We ordered the smoked pig tongue, bone marrow, and fried pig ears. To my surprise, there were only three pieces of pig tongue in the entire dish ($10). The flavor was extremely smoky and the texture was similar to that of jerky. This dish was a bit salty for my taste and left me gulping down my glass of water. If you are thinking about ordering the pig tongue, keep in mind that the portion is extremely small.The bone marrow dish is probably the most ordered dish at The Purple Pig. I enjoyed it the first time I came here but after ordering and eating it for the second time, I decided that the dish was a bit too oily for me. Honestly, I'm not quite sure what the bone marrow tastes like because I am unable to taste it. The only thing that the bone marrow added was more oil to the already oiled bread served with the dish. The salad had a certain sourness to it that was somewhat refreshing and cut through all of the other heavy, oiled flavors. Even though the bone marrow spread was extremely oily, it still tasted decently and the sea salt added a nice salty kick.The fried pig ears were unfortunately just too much fried-ness for me to handle. I am a huge fan of pig ears but I could barely taste them in this dish since they were so heavily breaded and fried. They simply tasted like giant fried breadcrumbs. The kale was perhaps my favorite part of this dish. It was lightly salted and so it tasted very similar to the seaweed sheets I loved to snack on when I was younger. The cherry peppers had a very strong sour flavor to them that overwhelmed the dish, making it difficult to finish.I appreciate that The Purple Pig has a large variety of dishes to choose from, but based on the ones I've tried, I can say that I am not a huge fan of this place.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xdHM5YCDlHVFTPOPWESwMw", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review_date": "7/5/2016", "user_name": "Karen Q."}, {"review": "A very small place for dining especially on winter time.

We expected it, so we put down our name and number and went to the Nordstrom near by to shop. We then got a text saying our table was almost ready. We were almost instantly seated.The restaurant is tapas style, which works like a family style restaurant where you order bunch of dishes to share, and dishes come out in no particular order. We ordered a bottle of red blend wine recommended by one of the wine specialist there. It was around $36, which was very affordable for us (3 poor college students haha).We ordered 3 dishes to go along with our wine: baked feta dish, fried pig ear, and the famous bone marrow. Im not much of a \"try exotic food\" person, but the bone marrow was too good \u00a0I def recommend it.All in all, I recommend Purple pig for a nice girls night out, dates, and just a nice outing to try great wine and beer!

The first time I came with my girlfriends and we sat at the chef's table. It was very cool to see how everything was prepared and the staff was great about explaining the dishes and giving us recommendations. And they are true experts! With all of our (probably) annoying questions about what they were making- they didn't skip a beat and ran that kitchen like a well oiled machine!1st time we ordered: bone marrow, lamb ribs, grilled octopus, broccoli, pear dessert. All was great. I felt like the broccoli was a tab heavy on the dressing, but the flavor was great (my other two friends highly disagreed, so who knows). My favorite dish was the lamb ribs- so unbelievably delicious!2nd time we ordered: whipped feta spread, chamomile pork steak, veal, chicken kebabs. Again, everything was great- but the chamomile pork steak was amazing. Definitely in my top 10 dishes of all time!If you haven't been, you must come! If you come between 6-9 you should expect to wait between 1-2 hrs, maybe more on the weekends. Trick of the trade- if you don't like waiting and don't mind having a late dinner come between 10-12. Place isn't insanely busy at that time, we had quick service, ate amazing food and had an easy walk to some great bars!The prices are on point for the serving sizes. 4 dishes for 3 people left us stuffed and we even had some leftover.My only disappointment is that I can't eat here everyday.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=19Mw3M3_cl5UeNuwvR9kWg", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review_date": "3/30/2017", "user_name": "Jaime B."}, {"review": "I wanted to take an out of town friend to a cool restaurant.

I felt like some dishes were a tad too oily or salty. I would say that their pate is above average, and that's the one thing I recommend here. The stuffed squid was another favorite of mine but it was on the salty side. The food here did not leave a lasting impression on me. I don't know if I caught this place on an off day, but this is just based on my one experience here.Service here was decent. We were seated at a community table, which I am not a fan of, but usually okay with. The girl sitting the edge did not move down all the way so I ended up in a really tight spot. It was clear to everyone else at the table that I was uncomfortable. When I asked the waitress if she could remove the seat next to me so that I would have more room, she just move that seat over an inch and basically told me to deal with it....but nicely, of course.. There was no one sitting next me so I don't see the problem with taking the seat away, but luckily the girl on the edge finished her meal and the next person scooted all the way down.

Inside is very small, with a couple of booths and small tables and a long table inside. The patio area had more room for larger groups. The restrooms are clean and well-maintained. The dining area is pretty dim, but the decor around the place is pretty cool.Due to the portion of the plates, I recommend getting around 3-4 plates per 2 people. The one item I highly recommend is the bone marrow. The bone marrow also comes bread, sea salt and herb salad. This dish was my favorite dish here. The bone marrow just melts in your mouth, and the bread and the perfect amount of salt that I added just tingles the taste buds. My second favorite item there had to the calamari. The calamari also included some veggies, but the kicker was the pistachios, which I would never though compliment the calamari. The other items we got were the House Made Veal Mortadella Sausage and the Octopus. The Veal was alright and the Octopus too me was a bit too salty. Overall, I did enjoy the food here and was pretty full after finishing all the food.The service here was very good. We were seating very quickly and got our food and drinks in a timely fashion. The seating here is cozy, so expect to overhear other conversations. We were talking and sharing stories with people all the way from Florida.

The menu is ever changing, seasonal and locally sourced where possible. We started with a 5 cheese platter & bone marrow (can I give more than 5* for this? Incredible).
