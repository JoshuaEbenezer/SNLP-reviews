"I ordered 3 dishes, fry pig ear with kale, pig liver, and trout. They are the worst dishes I ever taste. Fry pig ear with coated bread crumb, all I can taste is greasy breading and pond of salt. Pig liver in 3 tiny (about 3/4 inch diameter) portion, eatable but quantity is for tiny bird. Trout dish is so salty which I can' tell it's a fish at all. I leave right away after taste these 3 dishes. It cost $43 and so un-worth of trip. I had nightmare just think about those dishes. The restaurant  very noisy, and each table so cramp and close together. Waitress is unpleasant, same as their food. The Purple Pig restaurant totally serve CRAB!

"Best Buy Smart TV:  Best Buy's salmon assured me thatits warranty covers ALL smart TV repairs on site, free of charge, ""If anything goes wrong with the TV, you are covered!  if you buy the warranty, a repairman will come to your home free of charge.""  So I purchased the expensive warranty.  The TV is only a few months old and has never worked properly, but now, it does not work at all.  When I called customer service, I was put on hold for 25 minutes before I was able to even speak to the ""technician.""  The ""technician"" said Best Buy would not send anyone to service my TV unless I agreed to pay a $149 service charge, even though I am covered by the warranty, and he admitted I am covered by the warranty.  When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he put me on hold for 10 minutes and then disconnected me.  I called again, was put on hold again for 20 minutes and then spoke with another technician who seemed eager to help, but the only thing she could do for me was offer to mail me another remote.  I explained that I already have an extra remote.  She said she could not help me and suggested I call Samsung.","2/1/2016","1.0 star rating","XvikEzzNG3_L3zzmHWN6qg","Fern T."

"We heard so many great things about the Purple Pig to include; sometimes there is an 1.5 hour wait. We were lucky and got a table immediately. We ordered 3 apps and we watched as the waiter wrote them down. We only ever received 2 of the apps. Then we ordered an entree to share and kept waiting but it never came. Finally we asked for our bill as we realized no entree was going to come. Long story short we left there and went to the Capital Grille. Excellent always consistent dining at the Grille. In my opinion I predict the Purple Pig will be a quick hit popular restaurant and will quickly lose its appeal as diners realize the staff is not about the customer or dining experience. Upon bringing to the waiter's attention we did not get all of our order/food his only response was ""oh sorry"", then quickly walked away. ""Oh sorry?"" I'm sorry too. I'm sorry he did not care more about his job and the overall success of the restaurant that employs him. As we sat at the Capital Grille still steaming of the overall horrible experience, 3 separate individuals said they have either had the same experience at the Purple Pig and will not return or they have heard other people experiencing the same thing. I stress to management to get ahold of the business while business is good before it is too late and you lose it","4/27/2015","1.0 star rating","iwd9iX-6o3j-didcYAhM-w","Rich A."

"Most offensive experience I've ever had.  my friends and I decided to get a nice lunch on Easter Sunday.  We waited in line for the Purple Pig but we're refused service.  Why?  For some absurd reason, the waitress informed me that there were complaints against me for abusing my wife and I was clearly over served.  I am not married.  I was not with any women there.   And it's obvious that this is true as I do not have a wedding ring, spoke clearly and it was Easter Sunday - how could I be over served on Sunday morning.  Despite the obvious fault, management refused to serve us.  To summarize, we spent an hour waiting for a table only to be branded wife beater and drunkards and refused service.  F^%* this establishment and their staff.  My name is Michael, I honestly wish this establishment the worst.  How dumb can their staff be?  I don't use the phrase painfully stupid ever but the people there are painfully stupid.  Please refund me my dignity and an hours worth of time.F UThat is all","3/14/2015Updatedreview","1.0 star rating","BRsivX6UQCDtUPqZYUYSFw","Michael P."

"I had the worst dining experience here!  There is so much that needs improving I don't even know where to start.  The restaurant is very small, seating is very tight, communal tables.  There is not a lot of room for the servers to get by, so they are constantly bumping into you while you're trying to eat.  Apparently there is a lot of theft there too according to a staff member who advised us not to put our purses on the back of the chair.  No reservations!  We waited for toe hours for a part of 4.  We arrived at 4, not during busy dining hours.  The highlight of our night was the wine bar across the street!  Eno I think it is called.  The service was not great.  We felt rushed the entire meal, probably because of the limited seating.  The servers constantly were reaching and grabbing for things at the table. The food was HORRIBLE!  We are foodies and enjoy eating at places like the Girl and the Goat, so we are no strangers to different types of foods.   The food was overpriced and just blah!  Everything tasted the same...salty.   The brussel sprouts were the best thing we ate and that's saying something!  Overall, we were extremely disappointed.  I can't understand why this place is highly rated.  I've told everyone I know NOT to bother with it.","12/30/2014","1.0 star rating","6PV8AVnvRePV2F3w6Wgg6Q","Laura H."
"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. I was meeting some friends there who wanted to try this. A friend got there early to put our name in--he waited 90 minutes. When we got seated, we were put outside...under a tent with a few heat lamps. This tarp had many openings and the cold wind was blowing in. It's November in Chicago and was about 20 degrees outside. Way to show you don't care at all about your customer or their dining experience. We were crammed in, freezing, and everyone had to eat with their heavy coats and hats on. You know what else happens when you are sitting outside in Chicago in November? The food gets cold instantly. Even my red wine was cold. It was just such a rotten experience. The food might have been good, but how can you tell when you're that cold and the food arrives cold as well? I would never go back here. They don't take reservations, they clearly only care about cramming as many people in as they can to make the most money. There are so many better dining options in this city. I wouldn't give them another dime of my money,","11/17/2014","1.0 star rating","TO0mr3Tb8DWJZYFS-b_ZqA","Michael B."

"Great food.  Great location. Great Atmosphere.  *** July 16th dinner between 730 - 830pm sitting at the bar was the worst treatment I've ever received by a bar tender at any establishment in Chicago.***As usual the place was busy, but not crazy busy like some of the other nights I've been there.  I strolled up to the bar to order a drink for my girlfriend and I as the wait for the table as usual is roughly 2 hours.  So as most Purple Pig patron we usually order a drink and wait for a spot to open up at the bar to grab a seat and eat.  As I approached the bar the Bar Tender (the rudest, raciest, egotistic sh## Head) abruptly tells me that i need to order my drink from one of the other servers.  I don't know if the way I looked or something about me ticked this guy off as he was serving other patron who were standing beside me with all the libations that they desired.  I noticed that all of them were white and I was not.  I'm a pretty easy going guy and my girl friend is white and within a couple of minutes my girlfriend found a seat at the bar and nudged me over as the folks right next to her were about to leave and I was going to grab one of their seats.  We had still not ordered our drinks.  My girlfriend called the bar tender over and I asked if he could recommend a Pilsner.  Instead of getting a recommendation from him he rudely tells me to look at page 9 of their drink menu that he placed in front of me and abruptly walks away.  The patrons next to me and my girlfriend are in total shock to the bar tenders aggressive demeanor and tone of voice.  If I wanted to read the menu I would have done so and if he did not want to recommend a drink or beer, he could have politely said so  rather than giving me ""I hate serving you"" look and tone.  By this time I was starting to feel tense.  And I'm a pretty chilled guy.  We placed the order from our drinks and looked over the food menu and were ready to place the order for our food so we called Mr. Vigorous over to take our order.  He looked at my girlfriend and look at me and said ""he's gonna eat to"".  ""How"".  My girlfriend says ""he'll stand""  I was fuming by now.  Because this was getting to be very personal.  His demeanor, tone of voice and his questioning about my ability to eat standing up or sitting down was totally unwarranted and uncalled for.  The food was is and has always been good at the Purple Pig but I felt that the tone and position of the bar tender last night was based on the color of my skin and nothing else.  Its a shame the the ""Purple Pig"" has to hire ""Racist Pigs"" to serve.  Its an absolute shame.","7/17/2014","1.0 star rating","hzdKXXFSwTT-GQQslYCg9g","Vikram S."
"Let me just start out by saying that the people who think the food here is divine are posers and nut jobs with someone to impress. They MUST have something to prove because I was so underwhelmed by my meal, I had to hit the Wal-greens around the corner to get some chocolate-covered pretzels after we left. I had high hopes for this place. A friend of a friend recommended it, and my friends and I had walked past it the day before  and thought that it looked like a fun place to check out. I have to assume that this friend of a friend is a frenemy. We got there around 4:00PM and it is slightly crowded and that's fine. We waited a few minutes and a waitress brought our drinks out to us. We were seated a short while later at a large table that they deal with family-style. This is fine. As long as you don't have a douche bag 25 year old sitting next you speaking so loudly that EVERYONE on the outside patio can hear. Honestly. Who says, ""I am going to commission a piece from the artist""? Let me tell you who - this guy. We spent the next hour and 45 minutes listening to him talk over his companions, and the other 9 people seated at the table. I know that the restaurant cannot control this situation, but it just lends itself to our crappy experience. Here's what we ordered: Fried olives stuffed with chorizo - I didn't eat these, but the general concensus is that they were fine. Nothing to write home about. Or even to verbalize to the table. It's a fried olive. Fried eggplant with parmesan - They were OK. A gelatinous fried ball that tasted like cheese. Probably one of the better items from our list.Cheese plate - We had three cheeses: a chocolate goat cheese, a leceister cheese, and some gouda something or other. We didn't finish a single one of them. Seriously, I just needed a freaking Wheat Thin to eat with this. The buttered baguette was adequate, but not special.Pig heart sandwich, Chicago style - My friend ordered this and thought the pig heart tasted like roast beef. However, the sandwich itself was basically inedible. The bread was so hard that she couldn't eat it like a sandwich without cutting it. Here's my beef (or should I say ""pork"") with it: If you are serving me a freaking pig heart, make damn sure all the other pieces are good. Don't serve a rock hard loaf of bread with it. Because then, I am having to work my butt off to eat what many would think is offal. Seriously, the hotdog I had Mustard's Last Stand was a more appetizing choice than this.Chicken thigh kebabs - I know, I know... chicken thighs are fatty. But these were the fattiest, least savory chicken thighs I have ever sunk my teeth into. The best part of the entire meal, I kid you not, was the smashed and fried potato hanging out underneath the meat kebabs. The tziki sauce was fine. I've had better and I've had worse. Pineapple crusted pork something or other - Whatever this cut of meat was, it had a nice crust on it. Which was pretty much the only piece of the meat we could eat. As we dug through the meat, we found more fat and cartilege (bone???) than I would have thought possible. The guy next to me (not the DB, some other guy) had gotten it and eaten every bite. I have to ask myself... Did he eat ALL that fatty tissue and cartilge?? Did he??? If so, I am concerned for his health.So there's the rundown on the food. Now, on to the service. Which I think about as highly of as I do the food. Once we were seated my friend ordered the same drink that I already had in my hand. 20 - 30 minutes pass and no drink. Our waiter (who swapped with our original server) asked if there was anything we needed and my friend mentioned that she was still waiting on her drink. He became defensive and said it was at the bar. If it was at the bar, why not go ahead and bring it out? I made a joke about it and he wasn't impressed. I think if you are going to be in the service industry, you should know how to handle a joke. You are working with the public all day, every day.... deal with it! For these servers, it was a job. And you could tell. I've been to places where it's a profession and there's a noticeable distinction between those two roles. Our guy (and even the girl who we began with) are just there. Posers themselves. We spent the rest of our time at this restaurant waiting out the time so that we could go. I question anyone who swears by this place. I guess if you like leftover body parts, poorly prepared, you should check it out. IMMEDIATELY!","6/26/2014","1.0 star rating","uDix-JGXjvGlX3O8KQ3M0w","Alexa J."
"In the grand perspective, one star.  I didn't have to wait that long as I knew some of the staff and was seated ahead, Nice, but not cool for other guests, I would have been fine with waiting.I found the seating terrible and crowded. I like the idea of getting to know strangers and such, But I was seated next to a drunken wretch of a woman who would cackle ear piercing babble on a loop. I imagine someone could have a great experience, but I certainly didn'tThe food is memorable, tasty, but heavily salted and was mostly overpowered. Methinks chef is a smoker, not ok in my book.The biggest factor in my one star is kitchen related. you know those extremely egotistical nightmare chefs you hear about? this guy. I've become aware of numerous stories about drug use and the chef causing personal injury. I can never support a chef that creates a hostile kitchen and neither should you.It takes a lot to open a restaurant.  I can certainly appreciate a big business endeavor on Michigan avenue.

"I was so excited to check out Purple Pig after hearing some great things... I'd heard some bad things too, but discounted them since the restaurant was relatively new at the time and working through 'growing pains' at that point (I thought)... I decided to reserve judgment and didn't head there until it had been open almost a year.  When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation, we were told the wait would be at least 40 minutes. I don't mind waiting for a table (up to 2 hours) when I don't have a reservation. However, when I have a reservation, I don't expect to show up on time and wait for 40 minutes. What's worse is that our table was not actually ready in 40 minutes, but closer to 70. There was no accommodation made by the wait staff or management after such a long wait (and several 'check-ins' regarding time) such as a round of drinks, apps, etc. Furthermore, the staff was exceptionally snotty and rude, making our entire dining experience completely distasteful and atrocious. The food was actually quite good, but the entire experience was so clouded by the rude staff, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.","3/6/2011","1.0 star rating","WuZo3IRSV8d_JHYZf3hkFA","Jenna D."

"I've been part of the Yelp community for years now. However I've never written a review. I thoroughly enjoy reading all of the entertaining insights on all of the places I've worked  my 14 years in this business. It helps me to gain new insight in my chosen profession as ""director of cuisine"".  Not only does Yelp humor me-it humbles me as well. Let me be clear that I am breaking my oath to keep silent- strictly based on a service perspective. I have dined at the Purple Pig enough times to safely say that I have tried almost each and every item on the menu- It is brilliant and undeniably delicious. I  wake up craving particular items- plan my day around  how I can somehow squeeze there deliciousness into my break from my double at work. Like an addict I care not of the repercussions. I compare my relationship to The Purple Pig to that of a sick love affair with a married man. I get the meat I crave but none of the true tenderness that builds a lasting relationship. The service is painfully pretentious and unapologetic in being so. Each and every time I remind myself before heading there, not to expect a smile or a thank you. Each and every time I prepare myself for the rolled eyes or blatant ignorance of my simple  requests.  All of those issues seem to just dissipate the moment those flavors and textures hit my lips. But I have to say-after today I don't know how much more abuse I can take. I pride myself in the work I do-with the relationships I form with my customers, and I seek solace in putting my pride aside at times when I know I'm wrong. Next time you walk out the door of The Purple Pig-after throwing down a couple hundred bucks in this economy.......ask yourself this....""Do I feel like someone my significant other would take home to meet the parents-or did I just get screwed?""","11/13/2010","1.0 star rating","XVCZFTyiWhXtwJ-1wsjZEg","Julie L."
"I wrote a review about this restaurant just a couple of days ago and it has been removed . I find this to be sadder than anything . It wasn't a flattering review but it wasn't a flattering experience so I wrote what happened. All I want to say is good luck purple pig . I hope other people have a better experience there than I did but removing reviews to put up the facade that you are a perfect restaurant is ridiculous . You can still read my review if you check my profile to those yelpers interested . I can see why they wouldn't want the review read because the whole thing was an embarrassment . I eat at restaurants all over the world , and great ones at that . I heard great things about this place but they all turned out to be untrue in so many more aspects than I care to examine . I will never go back to the purple pig . It is about as classless as I have ever seen .","11/5/2010Updatedreview","1.0 star rating","jNK_YKdexVYMLN1-HErpgA","Charles C."
"I have never written a review before and signed up just to write this one. The service here was TERRIBLE. I have never experienced such horrible service in my life. The staff was also rude.Here's what happened: We showed up at 6:30 last night (a Thursday!), and the restaurant was packed. No worries, we expected that. The hostess told us that our party of four would be seated within a half hour, so we found a place at the bar and each had a glass of wine. A half hour rolls by, and I always get nervous about these things, so I went back up to the hostess and pointed out my boyfriend (who is very tall and noticeable) and said, that is Dave, who the reservation is under, we are standing at the bar right there, so that you can find us. She says, ""Great! You are next."" So I settle back in at the bar. More time passes, and we are still waiting, so we decide to just go ahead and order the bottle of wine we planned to have with dinner and to start it at the bar. I get nervous again so I send over Dave to check on our status. Once again, he tells the hostess where we are standing and asks about the status. She says, ""a table is going to open up any minute. You are next."" So we continue to be patient and keep drinking our wine at the bar. At one point, one of the hostesses comes over to us, and my boyfriend says, ""are you looking for Dave?"" and the hostess says, ""are you a party of 3?"" and Dave says ""No, we are a party of four."" Yet another half hour passes, so we send someone over again. At this point, we are informed that we lost our table because quote unquote ""We could not find you."" By then we are so frustrated and starved (and drunk) that we just leave. On the way out the door, one of the members of our party expresses our frustration to the manager, and the hostess says, ""Well we looked all over and could not find you. It is not my fault."" I'm sorry, you couldnt find the 6'3 guy at the bar, 10 ft from the hostess stand, who we pointed out multiple times? And then to be non-apologetic when you screw up, and blame it on the customer? They didn't even offer to pick up our bar tab. Unbelievable. Never going here again. Even Applebees has figured out a pager system. Give me a break.","11/5/2010","1.0 star rating","l5RfkyhxEELj8MMWRXwQsw","Julia B."

"With so many great reviews and people everywhere raving about The Purple Pig I had to give it a try.  Maybe it was the greasy food, maybe it was the cramped communal seating, maybe it was the slow service, or maybe a combination of several things just left a bad taste in my mouth.  The crispy pig ear was good, and was the best of several items we ordered.  I do not regret going, but it's not for me and once was enough.","11/29/2015","2.0 star rating","pFa2-5eUnepnBiLt1mA_Xw","Andy T."

"I want to give this restaurant a higher review but the service is simply lacking. I have been on quite a few occasions and there never seems to be enough staff. I have gone with a crew of restaurant industry veterans after hours and sat for 30 minutes after receiving a taste of the wine I ordered only to never receive a full glass pour. On other visits they have been woefully out of menu items. Another visit I ordered a 5oz pour of wine and received the 8oz, was overcharged, and it wasn't corrected. The food I have received was good, the location is great, but this is a very overvalued place with inflated prices and too much of an ego for what it really delivers.

"purple pig ... hmm. well, i went there with my boyfriend to have dinner because we heard its really good here. we got there but the wait was 1 hr so we waited. Anyways when we got there the place was packed in and outside the patio. We got the patio sitting because it was too pack inside and it was raining a lot too. We got wet from the rain pouring down on us. But anywho, when we got there we order the bone narrow it was so greasy and salty. And there was barely anything in there for $18 ! It's like sipping on oil. I also ordered the turkey leg, deviled eggs and another appetizer but none of the dishes were edible to us because it's either super salty or oily. It was a failed experience. Never again !!!! Ugh. We barely ate our food but none of the waiters/waitress ask how was the food even when it's like full plate wasted. Was so disappointed. We spent $120 for 2 entree and 3 appetizers.","8/20/2014","2.0 star rating","GyZAKdQkCHJUlmllggrmxw","Justine D."
"THIS PLACE IS GREAT IF YOU WANT TO BE MANIPULTED OUT YOU $ by the restaurant. No reservations- why. So they can run up your alcohol tab while you wait nearly two hours. When you finally do get seated you're crammed into a space that is so noisy you can barely carry on a conversation. Food was just ok. Pork shoulder was very salty and a third fat.

"We were visiting Chicago last weekend and came here for drinks. There was a big group of us (7) and we walked right on the patio and sat at a big table. To be fair, I'm not sure whether or not we were supposed to seat ourselves but no one told us either way. The serving staff was extremely rude and SLOW, and I should also say that most of our party works in the restaurant business and therefore are very patient and understanding. If the staff was snotty because we sat ourselves then someone could (and should) have politely approached us and told us. We would have been more than happy to get up and wait. However, it seems to me they are just rude and stuck up. Would not recommend, or go to, this place again.","8/7/2013","2.0 star rating","Dy6Z8JR1Mq8VTRSQynAWkw","Jennifer H."

"was here last weekend and kind of disappointed. I loved the food, as always, pork shoulder is just amazing! and the chicken thigh kabobs are the best. however, we waited almost 2 hours for a table, after being told that it would be one hour, and the tried to seat us outside. it was freezing!! and there was no music, I wanted the same experience I always had here...on the inside. I wasn't about to drop over a hundred bucks on food after waiting two hours to shiver in silence the entire time. The ended up being able to seat us inside but not at our own table and the long tables that we shared with others are extremely bulky and do not allow people to move over and use the full space of the table, not to mention its impossible to cross your legs. I was going nuts. I will be back because i love it, but I just need to make sure we can sit on the right side with the individual tables and long booth.","5/31/2013","2.0 star rating","hAxqJ_gcoQxyK_FZJQYj9Q","Corey N."

"My husband and I ate lunch at the Pig on Sunday.  We arrived early and were the third and fourth people seated in the propane-heated outdoor section.  We ordered pretty quickly, as we are familiar with the menu, and the appetizer and smear came out in short order.  Next, my husband's entree was delivered but mine was not.  The restaurant got increasingly busy.  About 12 minutes after his meal was served, our LYING waitress told us mine would be out in 1 minute. After 5 minutes she returned to say she saw them ""plating"" it and it would be ""right out.""  Another 15 minutes later I went inside and asked them to cancel my entree and give us the check.  The excuse was that they were very busy.  (I had been there before the place was busy and saw all sorts of later-comers being served.)  Wait another 5 minutes.  Our waitress brings out some oyster balls to ""comp"" us.  No thank you.  She goes back to get the check.  A different person appears and tries to serve my entree.  I told her that we did not need it any longer and she proceeded to deliver it directly to another table.  No joke.  We watched her.  Only my entree was taken off the bill, but everything else was listed and charged.  They could have done better.  DO NOT LIE TO CUSTOMERS.  Serve them in an appropriate timeframe.  The food is great.  I only wish the service was better.","11/26/2012","2.0 star rating","NoAp3lBlvoVwl-1VJF0Cgw","V P."
"I might consider giving a second chance to them, but my first visit did not leave me that impressed. We did arrive at 11:15 pm and they do close the kitchen at midnight, we were greeted by the friendly host, so we are off to a good start. Then we are greeted by one of the servers who goes over the menu made some good suggestions and brings our drinks.  We do place the order with her and the appetizer is brought out.  The  appetizer is an artichoke and potato combination with goat cheese. I take one bite and thought perhaps it was just me, but when I look at my partner his expression was priceless.  The appetizer did not have a good taste to it, almost as if it had been sitting int he refrigerator uncovered collecting the different tastes of the refrigerator. In the meantime I take a sip of my soda, flat! Ok so stuff happens, we ask the busboy if he can please take it back and get a new one or tell the server.  He comes back and lets us know the server would bring it out because she had to enter it into the computer?  Still no problem. A server other than our initial one approaches us and states that they are looking at changing the soda and will bring one out asap! Thanks for the follow up, although you were not the server who greeted me, took orders, made suggestions.  So our entrees come out.  I had the chicken kabob and my partner had the pork sandwich.  The sandwich was delicious I actually ended up eating more of that than my entree.  The kabob really was not that great of a presentation, it actually looked like a plate of slop because of the watery tzatsiki sauce, what appeared to be three potatoes and perhaps the juice or grease from the chicken combining together.  The chicken was ok, actually my partner liked my dish more and I his so we just swapped. In the meantime we really did not see anymore of our server until the end of the meal and the nice lady who came by earlier stopped by to see how things were. So at this point we tell her about the appetizer she was nice about it and apologized. They did end up taking it off the check. The place is cute, but the exhaust fans must not be working right or they turned them off later in the evening.  The place smelled like grease/smoky I could not wait to get out.  Perhaps they were cleaning the kitchen and had turned off the fans?  Whatever it  was I was grateful to go out for fresh air. Some suggestions for the servers if you are going to trade off a table, it is customary to let your table know that a new server will be taking care of them so we are not looking for you. Like I said I would consider giving them a second chance, but my first impression was not that great.","9/12/2012","2.0 star rating","O249gs_CMps5z3JFcA-LsQ","Tina B."

This is what you need to know. great food, small portions. you'll drop 300 with a party of 4. However, the service is so bad its amazing that it can be categorized in the hospitality business. It should be re categorized into condescending experiences. Reminds me of getting ripped off by a mechanic without the smile.There is nothing hospitable about any of this staff. The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be there. In this friggin economy? Maybe if Avec, Blackbird, Bristol, Publican, and all the other restaurants that can deliver on both sides of the dining out experience. It is not enough to just offer great food at 100 bucks a head. You need to offer service just like all these other places do. Look at all the reviews people.

"SO this review was removed but here it is again . THIS IS A TRUE STORY!!!BAD MANAGEMENT! read onOk So I tried out the purple pig due to recommendations from friends . I had read mixed reviews on yelp but we thought we'd give it a shot . I never made it to a table ! I went in with a group of friends . We were told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes which is understandable in a place that doesn't take reservations . I'Ve waited two hours to eat at Frontera and it was amazing , so needless to say the wait doesn't bother me if the food is good. The problem here is that I never was able to try the food because I would not support this place after the conversation I had with the manger . First off he was rude . He just came off as curt and seemed disinterested in helping a group of young women. He instead kept ushering in big guys in suits . He told me  that whose people were VIPs and they get first seating . I asked why all customers weren't considered VIP's and he laughed with this little chuckle and actually said to me "" Lady , we can all only hope to have the money these guys have someday , so until you do these gentlemen are VIPs and they go first , if you don't like that you can leave.""WHAT!?!  I immediately asked his name and he said he was busy . We stormed out of the place but on the way out I asked a server what his name was and I was told his name was John . Well John you can have your VIPs and all their money .

The best thing of the night, other then the desert, and eating outside was the potato that accompanied the chicken thigh. The desert, panini of hazelnut, banana, and marshmallow fluff was pretty good.  The pig platter, and assortment of meats from a pig, were quite underwhelming.

"The food was very tasty and the service is great. Decided to try out the marrow. This was ok, but it's kind of bland. The lamb ribs are amazing, it's cooked perfectly! This place is a must try!","1/24/2017","3.0 star rating","D1RZk3tvNPDF6ufcPodY6g","Rick W."
"Overall my experience was good and the food was actually quite tasty, but I was really upset by a few things:a) My biggest complaint by far was that the entire place was too crowded. They were trying to fit way too many people inside the restaurant. It must have exceeded the occupancy limit. I've never been in a restaurant this crowded before. MOST of the seating is at ""community tables"" or whatever they call it, and you are literally sitting at one big table slammed right up against everyone else in other parties with zero separation or barrier. Most places that do this leave a gap of one chair or something, but I was literally brushing elbows the entire night with some random person next to me as if I was on an airplane, and it made it very difficult to have conversations because you heard people around you the entire time. We actually knew this ahead of time and specifically asked for a table, but we were seated at the community area anyway. Even the tables though have basically zero separation and many of them are in awkward places (i.e. right by the bathrooms or right in front of a door).b) The service was good and they cleared plates quickly, but there was a server who literally stared at me the entire time waiting to pickup plates as soon as I was done. It was kind of creepy and very awkward. I appreciate attentive quick service, but he was just standing there staring at me most of the time I was dining.c) All of the dishes tasted great, but a few were soaked in oil and way too salty.If this restaurant were to make a little more space, I would definitely go back and I think my experience would have been much more positive.","1/8/2017","3.0 star rating","5Uytpq7M8QSDPqdOpKZ9QA","Karl S."

"My aunt recommended this place to try. I think we must have ordered poorly because none of the dishes really stood out to me. The staff was very nice though and the place was very cute and trendy. For now, I think I will say it's worth a try, but ask your server what the most popular items are because we took the advice of some local folks who were regulars there, and our taste buds didn't align. Oh well, here's to an excuse to go back to Chicago!","5/13/2016","3.0 star rating","36pk965n48XWd7d6dTzyaw","Adina B."

This kind of restaurant should be explored a little more.Servers where a little bad. you can easily spot how nervous they walk in the dining area which makes me uneasy.It was a splendid dinner having my Turkey Leg looks so delicious, I ate the whole and it made me full.Thanks.","1/18/2016","3.0 star rating","WG1qUvK5RNK2l2rtEm85Eg","Verl M."

"I had wanted to come here for forever because I work not far and I saw the sign for it and people talked about it. To be honest this place is okay but disappointing. Maybe it is because I always wondered what it would be like. It's just not very special. I don't know if it is trying to be BBQ or trying to be fancy. It's expensive but it doesn't really succeed as being fancy. I left feeling hungry because portions are small. To me in just my opinion I would not com there again and would instead keep walking down Michigan Avenue and go to Grand Luxe or to Lawry's. There are much better places to get BBQ and chops and all that.","1/12/2016","3.0 star rating","I1J5PpwI1xuCvW9kS6xdbg","Lamar B."

"I love the food but the seating is so tight that it's hard to enjoy the dining experience fully, with your neighbors right on top of you. I highly recommend the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic, the Broccoli with Roasted Garlic & Anchovy Vinaigrette, and the Fried Brussels Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes. To avoid the crowds, I recommend you try to dine here mid-afternoon, just after lunch but well before dinner, to avoid the claustrophobic feel of this restaurant. The food is delicious and so the crowds are warranted, but they pack the tables in to maximize seating and so that crush of guests is evident and makes a negative impact, in my opinion.","8/26/2015","3.0 star rating","anM5JbF7cfgTnthcf9xDbg","Becca S."
