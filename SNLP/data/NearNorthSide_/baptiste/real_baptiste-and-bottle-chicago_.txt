And know about it you now do.It's elegance refined. There's staff to greet you at the door, the menu is filled with delicious items and those windows. Oh man, the 360 view windows overlooking the city are just stunning, day or night. I've been here for both breakfast and for drinks and the atmosphere remains the same: classy, cool but not pretentious. You don't have to be well groomed to fit in here, although you would fit in if you were. Grab a seat, you're welcome.The service can be a little slow at times.

First they charged us for drinks we didnt order like we ordered alot of a food n they jus started giving us things asked for extra sauce n got charged thought that was bogus best things crudo, scallops, oxtail, wings, duck spatzle, eggnog, chocolate covered bananaCrudo (japanese snapper) $15 amaizin fish really fresh love that its not supper acidic theres real complexity the plum adds a great sweetness then the sauce is really rich then theres apples that add great crunch and acidity the puffed rice was amaizin its like a texture explosion first raw seafood preparation with loads of texture must orderBone marrow/ oxtail 16$ amaizin one of the best bone marrows i ever had really decadent. The oxtail was really rich. Theres fried onions and alot of texture wich i really enjoyed. The bread was supper buttery and rich my only complaint is that i wish there was something to cut down the richness like something sweet and acidic but besides that a really rich tasting!Scallops 32$: the best scallop dish i ever had. The sauce is so rich and decadent n the cauliflower adds a nice fresh note. The scallops have a sear on them n their not over cooked only complaint wish they were a little bit more crunchier n a lil more tender but still good jus make sure u dry scallops before hand n put the pan really high to get a good \u00a0 Sear scoring the scallops would help toWings 13$: amaizin. These were the most tenderest wings i ever had like literly juice was gushing out after each bite. They were really big and crunchy. The sauce is really rich n sweet i liked the addition of scallions n sesame seeds if u added chopped nuts that would have been cool. Wish it was a lil spicy to balance out flavors Ask for the chipotle sauce its so rich and decadent the spicy rich flavor goes beutifully with these. Are they the best i ever had? No thats dos urban cantina but they are amaizin jus wish they would give u more wings for the price still if u want wings get thisBeets +Burrata 14$ good but i think goat cheese would have paired better with the components of the dish. The beets were really rich n werent hard. Its like a rich acidic dish adding something sweet would have really help balance the flavors n more croutons for crunch would be greatRoasted pekin duck breast 29$ good not great there were some issues. Skin was not crispy it was soggy. For some odd reason the duck was tuff. I liked the white sauce added great richness n the gooseberries added great acidity. I liked the fried potatoes just put more n make sure their cripsy i loved the figs jus put more duck needs something sweet if u mad a jam or a fig sauce would have been better jus fix the issues n would be greatSpatzle + duck confit $18 amaizin (crack egg n mix it as soon as dish comes to u): its like a fancy mac n cheese. The egg was perfectly cooked and added great richness i liked the addition of the mushrooms adds a great earthy flavor. I loved the duck confit supper tender and rich i didnt care for the foam feel like foams are jus for presentation n lacks flavor. My only complaints bout this dish is make the spitzel crispy n add some bread crumbs or oats for crunch. Then add some bacon or chorizo for some salty richness then add something spicy an acidic like pickled jalepenos n plz add some more cheese there could never be enoughFried eggnog bread pudding 10$ (donut with cinnamon n sugar) one of the best desserts i ever had. The donut was perfectly fried without being greasy n was perfect texturely like really soft and airy. The chestnut tuile added a great crunch n tasted amaizn i loved the acidic sauce to cut down the sweetness n the icecream was so good i would come back jus for thisChocolate covered banana 10$ (chocolate mouse/chocolate cake)The log is a banana mouse really tasty theres alot of chocolate in this dish theres puppy chow that adds great crunch then theres hazelnuts so it tastes like chocolate would order this again jus only complaint add some salt or bacon to add saltiness n some chili powder to give it some pop n boom best dish ever also add more cakeCookie butter (its chocolate mouse n cookie dough batter) didnt really like this theres no texture its to mushy and sweet add something salty,savory,acidic,spicy. Add some cake then fry the cookie butter or make cookies i love cookie dough but u either do cookie dough or mouse not both"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mlAIo1g-KmvWZS0suxIhIg", "review_date": "3/28/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Nerissa T.", "review": "Came here for a Yelp event last night and I was quite impressed!

Add to that 20th floor views of the River North area and the question could easily become what are you waiting for? \u00a0The pricing for the Bloody & Mimosa unlimited features were $18 each and other featured cocktails were in the $12 price range. Interestingly, with the bloody bar, you were allowed to choose Tequila (Maria), Bourbon (Baron) or Vodka (Mary) before adding the housemade mix and garnishes of your choice. I opted for a mimosa but found the garnishes for bloody bar rather tempting. Cocktails aside, the smoked brisket served with a fried egg, cheese curds and onions was melt in your mouth goodness.

Bummed that we weren't allowed a plus one, I took this as an opportunity to put myself out there and try to be outgoing (a struggle at times for me). I couldn't be happier that I did! To start, the space was really beautiful. Before you even enter the bar/dining area, there's a really pretty atrium where you can have a seat. Once you enter the bar area, there's a long communal table, seats at the bar, highboys, and larger sit-down areas. The entire menu looked awesome, but we may have had a slightly different menu for the evening. There was a crudo offering of snapper, the Bone Marrow + Oxtail Marmalade on grilled brioche (delicious!), and the Day Boat Scallops, which I probably could've had about 5 more of.Service was excellent, particularly from Miller, Joshua, and one other (Tom? Tim?

The lounge area just outside the bar is gorgeous; I love the decor hanging from the ceiling (Origami cranes? Paper airplanes? Cool-looking, whatever they are!) and the couches.We sat at the bar and ordered steak frites and chicken and waffles as a good base for the liquor. The steak frites were as amazing as they damn well better be for $22; the steak was a perfectly juicy and tender medium-rare served with Parmesan truffle fries. The fried chicken was crispy atop the fluffy Belgian waffle it was served on. Now, the booze. My husband and I love to ask questions about drinks and get recommendations from the bartenders, especially in places like this which advertise themselves as bourbon-centric and you, know, a cocktail bar. What we don't love is regurgitating what we've read on the menu and an \"I don't know, it depends on what you want to try\" left to trail off until we awkwardly just pick something. It's awesome to hire pretty women; it's more awesome to hire people that know what they're talking about when you're trying to position yourself as a \"destination\" for rare and elevated spirits and not as a dive bar with a disinterested waitress. Our bartender couldn't tell us anything about anything they served to the point I'm not sure if she's ever even tasted anything they offer. My husband went ahead and picked a flight, and thankfully it came with small description cards of the included whiskeys to tell us what the staff couldn't. I chose a Dealer's Roulette ($13) and got a Gin & Prosecco, so the imagination here barely strays from mimosa. I mean, they serve drinks with carbonated green tea, rosemary, blood orange, etc, and that's the creativity on display given free range?

The whiskey and bourbon list is extensive and the tableside cocktail service is a unique touch.

Another nice feature here: they offer a \"locker program\" so if you purchase a bottle of whiskey, you may consume it at once (go for it!) or they offer to store it in their library for up to six months (no locker fee.) \"Don't bogart the biscuit,\" I'll be prepared to say when I'm here with friends this summer - the cheddar and chive biscuit was dense and delicious, served a la carte and you likely will be wise to request one apiece if you enjoy this tasty starch. The menu rotates and an example of the selection of appetizers from: Bison Carpaccio to several choices of salads, a seasonal soup or the Bone Marrow and Oxtail Marmalade should you desire something heavier. The main courses, as well, display a nice variety of fish, chicken and red meat (a burger too) and I do believe they always offer one vegetable-oriented entree but I suppose if you are vegan, vegetarian, GF you call ahead to verify and especially a place like this which focuses on a seasonal menu.

What helps is a fantastic staff starting with the awesome Wes, who was responsible for making our delicious cocktails. It probably doesn't hurt either that General Manager and Executive Chef, James Lintelmann, has experience at Charlie Trotter's, Boka, and in Napa Valley.Now we only drank here so did not partake in any of the wonderful sounding and beautiful looking food that they have on the menu. That will definitely change next time. Of the 4 cocktails we had, 3 were outstanding, with the other one being just good. The outstanding ones were the La Do\u00f1a, Fig Daisy, and Prince Edward. Each was unique from one another and from the usual cocktails you see on bar menus. Each had a depth of flavor making you wish your drink would never end. The not outstanding, but still good one was the Sweater Vest which any mezcal fan would appreciate. Plus, not only is this place great for a whiskey lover like me, but it is also quite welcoming to the whiskey novice who may be intrigued by the brown spirit and would like to learn and understand more of wondrous benefits it has to offer.Somehow Baptiste & Bottle manages to give the feeling that you're out for a special occasion, while also being somewhere you could easily return to on any night.

It was a very elegant evening. The restaurant is located on the 20th floor \u00a0and the views were pretty cool. The atrium was my favorite part. Tom was very attentive and personable as was the rest of the staff throughout the entire evening. They had three different light bites available to try. The scallops were definitely my favorite, but the bone marrow/oxtail dish was pretty delicious as well.The drinks were definitely flowing, and while I enjoyed my pinot noir, it felt like some people over-enjoyed their drinks. I am all for having a good time and letting loose, but when you are drunk and invading other people's personal space you should probably slow down. I bring this up only because I really want to say thank you to Miller and Josh because after identifying that we were uncomfortable they swooped in very casually and made sure that we were enjoying ourselves without making it obvious. I really was the most impressed with that situation. The food was great, the service was awesome, but the ability to identify when patrons are uncomfortable and handle a situation without causing a bigger commotion is extremely important and should be highlighted. We also had an opportunity to meet with Chef James who was really awesome and down to earth. The rooftop is opening soon and I can't wait for it to be nice enough outside because drinks and sushi with a view sounds awesome!I will definitely be returning with my husband to try brunch and to order some of the \"instagrammable\" tableside drinks that smoke or light on fire!"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=a4seSZMF9QxPBGAJ9MjaPw", "review_date": "12/24/2016", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Stephanie L.", "review": "I'm being a little pretentious BUT if you are saying you are a bourbon bar...maybe get some bourbon that isn't mainstream. \u00a0Everything on the menu, you can pick up at ANY liquor store. \u00a0There's nothing really special about this place.That being said, we just went for some cocktails and they were good. \u00a0Not amazing, good. \u00a0They do a whole show with the huntsman and it's cool but kind of gimmicky...alas, I love the allure of stuff like that.It's a nice space downtown. \u00a0In the bar area, there was some great views."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4t2FhsUYlp6O910O5PN7Dg", "review_date": "4/30/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Francine B.", "review": "Surprisingly great food and was so nice to try different plates and tastes.

We dined on January 21st, an unusually warm night. I had picked the perfect place to surprise my fianc\u00e9 with. His love of bourbon and our desire to try new hot spots in Chicago were perfectly married. No punt intended!! \u00a0The view was breathtaking and the food to match. We started the dinner with the casper's courage made with aviation gin / raspberry / lemon / sparkling wine and the southside mulekoval \"baptiste series\" bourbon / pineapple-rosemary shrub / ginger. The Casper on the more bubbly side was ok but the south side mule in the pineapple vessel was delicious. For starters our waitress recommended the CRUDO market fish / charred scallion / plum / radish. This was the fresh start to dinner that we needed. For entrees we had the sea bass flavors of bouillabaisse / absynth / olive and spaetzle + DUCK CONFIT 62 degree egg / maitake mushroom / chestnut. Both dishes complimented the flavors in our cocktails. Side dish of eggplant + harissa + hazelnut + feta was super flavorful and a good addition to both the fish and duck. What stole the show was the sleek and sultry bar cart that was escorted through the restaurant space. We couldn't help but order The huntsman glenfiddich 14 yr scotch / punt e mes / apricot / rooibos smoke. Kim the \u00a0bar cart girl was amazing at explaining every last ingredient she put into the intoxicating drink. The wealth of knowledge as she explained each component was impressive. My fianc\u00e9 and her had a lengthy conversation about the drink she prepared as well as all her tools. He was very interested in all the unique pieces as she told him the manager personally looks for each. She was definitely graceful as she swept around the room and we couldn't help but watch her make other guests' drinks. \u00a0For a final sweet bit we had the chocolate MESS cookie butter / ganache / gianduja stracciatella. This was the richest dessert I've ever had. I don't necessarily recommend it. I found it to be too over powering in sugar. I think it was our waitress' only fail on recommendations. Overall the most AMAZING meal in a while.

Great call!!!!We were greeted by a friendly hostess and, while waiting at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive, were treated to the house special drink. \u00a0Great start to what ended up being a memorable and delicious meal! \u00a0We sampled a few of the cocktails but maybe the most fun was the dealer's roulette...pick your spirit and leave it in the hands of the professional. The spicy mezcal concoction that was the result was tremendous. When it came to the menu it all looked great so we opted to try a bunch of plates smallish and largeish and share. Here's the breakdown:Pimento Cheese Starter was awesome. Wish we could have taken a pint of that home!The cheddar chive biscuit was definitely a highlight. Giant, flaky, tender, magical. \u00a0Bone Marrow and Oxtail was rich and delicious. Easy enough to share. Oxtail was crazy tended. Spaetzle with Duck Confit was BOMB. I'm a sucker for duck and the addition of the 62 degree egg added such a perfect saucy goodness.Red Snapper was the least memorable dish of the night but still really yummy.Brussels Sprouts with Pistachio...not a combo I've had before but awesome. Even my friend who doesn't like Sprouts loved these.Day Boat Scallops. Ok...these were perfection. The sunchoke pur\u00e9e was super smooth and a great compliment to the hard sear on the scallop. One ding on this...the standard order is 3 scallops. There were 4 of us eating but for a slight upcharge the kitchen could add a 4th. Unfortunately, this resulted in three big juicy perfectly golden scallops and one sad, slightly over cooked, significantly smaller unloved forgotten add on. \u00a0I took one for the team and added the \"special\" scallop. \u00a0Everyone else said theirs were hands down the best bite of the evening.Dessert we had the apple crisp with cheddar shortbread...awesome combo of savory and sweet...also the pineapple ambrosia. \u00a0The ambrosia was another reason to return dish. Light, airy, refreshing, and not too sweet. A really solid end to a tremendous feast.Our waitress was outstanding. She did a great job explaining the menu and an outstanding job pacing out meal. \u00a0Only other suggestion, and the other point that kept this from being a 5 star review, would be that there was no description of the dishes when the food runner dropped off our plate. \u00a0The dishes were gorgeous and taste was in point, but just a quick rundown would have been appreciated.

The food was pretty tasty and overall well-executed: \u00a0 \u00a0:: Fingerling potatoes (small):: The smoked trout and apple did add some interesting flavors and texture.  \u00a0 \u00a0:: Cheddar & chive biscuit (side):: freshly baked and extremely fluffy.The biscuit itself had a hint of sweetness and was buttery enough that I did not need the honey butter on the side. I am seriously considering ordering this to go. Very generous portion size. \u00a0 \u00a0:: Brussels sprouts & pistachio (side):: lots of flavors and textures in one bite thanks to the pistachio, slightly charred brussels sprouts, and candied grapes/currants. \u00a0 \u00a0:: Spaetzle & duck confit (large):: LOVE AT FIRST BITE. We had fun poking and stirring the 62-degree egg (slow cooked in the shell in a water bath of 62C degrees). I could be wrong but the mushrooms were treated differently, some acidic and some savory. I loved the anticipation of which version I would get in my next bite. I wish the duck was a bit more tender. Nonetheless, this was my favorite. \u00a0 \u00a0:: B&B burget (large):: my least favorite item. Maybe it was because it was two thin(ner) patties, I thought the burger was overcooked to my medium-rare order. Fries were great though.

This place is so freaking cute. The atmosphere is amazing the second you walk in. The views are breath taking! The front area seemed to be bigger groups and the back was more couples/quieter. The second we sat down, we were treated with a complimentary drink. Almost a mojito that they were going around serving out of a giant ship. It was delicious! Then the next thing we know, the server brought us free shooters. THEN they brought out complimentary radishes with pimento cheese. What??? So much free stuff! It was small and delicious and got us very excited about our meals. What a great way to start your meal and birthday celebration!For drinks I tried the Dealer's Roulette both times and unfortunately didn't LOVE either one.. Might just be the waiter not sharing my wants correctly. Wish I'd just gone with a cocktail from the menu. \u00a0Most of the food was good, but needs a little work. - Chive biscuit was fabulous. Might have been the best biscuit i've ever had. I'd go back for that alone. - Squash & Burrata was a little odd. Both were soft and the dish needed something crispy to offset it. I wish it had some giant croutons or bread or something to balance the soft cheese. The flavors were great though. - Mac & Cheese was pretty disappointing. They use a stringy cheese, which makes the dish more chewy than gooey. Wasn't a fan of that.. - Amish Chicken was a huge rip off for $25. You get 1 breast cut in half for $25.. what?? that's a price of a half or full chicken at most places. Unacceptable.- Cookie Butter dessert was pretty darn fabulous. They brought out a candle on it, which was nice. It was a little overwhelming in texture after a while. Very very rich. Might be helpful to have something additional on there to help lighten it up.

I personally got the scallops ($29) and they were delicious. Drinks were pretty yummy and beautifully presented. The reason for the lack of 5/5 rating is because it took sooo longgggg to get our food to the point we had to go to another restaurant after our visit to feel somewhat full due to the smaller portions.

I asked if they served bread to tie our hungry stomachs until the food arrived, but the waitress replied they had a biscuits available on the menu, but it would arrive after the food would - so my party opted not to order any. When the food did come, the waitress added two biscuits on the house for the wait.While its very appreciated that the restaurant tried to makeup for their untimeliness with the two complimentary biscuits for my party of 6, it would have been appreciated if the meal was timed better and that the first time prompt to the waitress warranted a quicker food delivery time. While the time did pass quite quickly while waiting for the drinks, examining in hindsight that it took 22 minutes for the drinks to arrive is also a long time. The restaurant was not full or busy at the time.Wouldn't recommend for a full meal with a larger party for a special event but I think Baptiste & Bottle is a good place for a date with drinks & snacks where the longer wait times are appreciated to allow for conversation."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kh1bOJ28-MiBI61V7GkGWA", "review_date": "2/5/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Eric L.", "review": "Free valet parking for customers.

People from Alabama headed to Chicago in the dead of winter? Are they nuts? BRR!). We spent a day downtown. Took the Metra in from the west suburbs (all y'all HAVE to get the Ventra app), trundled around the city on the bus (Transit app!!). Michigan Avenue was, of course, all lit up and beautiful. For dinner, we came here. Where was it? In a hotel? OK, a nice hotel, but still - a hotel? We were afraid of disappointment. But here we were at a place with a lot of great Yelp reviews and the promise of a nice view of the city. We jumped on the elevator.Elevator doors open, two hungry, slightly disheveled and moderately frozen Alabonians step out. There wasn't an obvious sign on the restaurant (it's on the floor, of course?), but it's over to the right, where you see the bar. The very attractive bar. The whole restaurant is very attractive. The tables are attractive, the seating is attractive, the floor, ceiling and walls - attractive. And the view out the windows is wonderful. Be sure to go just before or long enough after regular Chicago mealtimes so you can sit at the window. Mahvelous. Despite our non-Michigan-Av exteriors (and interiors), the very nice hostess sat us at one of the best window seats in the place. (Secret: they're all the best.)Drinks first! It's a whiskey (or whisky, depending on what you're getting) bar, so get whisk(e)y. We shared the Vertical Expression, samples of three different whiskeys. You start with the, er, least expensive. It was at the top end of what I'd have considered buying before I tried this flight. It was fine.The second one was Michters, a 10-year-old single barrel from PA. This one was clearly better than the, er, lowest of the three. Clearly. Cleaner, smoother, much more interesting. I'd be proud to serve this to good friends. Gonna have to throw out that swill in my cabinet. Or drink it. (Definitely drink it. But I won't enjoy it!)And then there was Elijah Craig 12 Year Bourbon. Yah, I know there are much better and classier whiskeys out there, but dang it, I've never had one before. This stuff was great. Its color is described as \"burlap sack\". You have to be great to be able to suffer being described as \"burlap sack\" and not be embarrassed. No embarrassment here - this stuff was smooth with a little bit of the devil waaay in the background; friendly-toasty-flavored in the way your favorite dog sits on your lap or feet and keeps you warm while you scratch its ears. It loves you and wants you to relax and do whatever it is you're doing: talk with your wife, watch football with your buds, read the paper, whatever; but don't worry about work or your neighbor's weedy lawn or your knucklehead brother-in-law.Yeah. Get that.We had dinner, too. My wife had the scallops. They were big, perfectly prepared, perfectly tender and so piping hot that you'd have thought they were cooked at the table. Get that. I got chicken mole, a special. The best moles are rich and both bold and subtle; this was one of those. Just phenomenal for the price, I thought. If they offer it whilst you're there, make sure someone at your table gets that and make sure they let you try it. If you order it, though, consider being selfish. The heirloom carrots were fine, but I'd guess that one of the other sides might be better. (Might have been my fault - carrots and mole? Not an ideal combination.)We shared a Chocolate Mess for dessert. It was better than delicious, much better. Get that.All the while, we'd been pleasantly served by friendly, efficient and very, very helpful staff, including a manager, a very professional man I figured on first appearance alone to be stuffy and hard to work with. But that couldn't be - his people appeared to be proud to be working there, cooperative with each other - and there was quite a bit of twinkle-eyed yet professional joshing between the floor workers, wait staff, table-clearers, bartenders and kitchen staff all. Great team, all y'all. And teams like that have to have good managers, not sourpusses (sourpi?).He, the manager, wasn't a sourpuss at all. In fact, he hung out for a few minutes and discussed whiskey, the view and ... a new drink he suggested we try called Spanish Coffee. I'd get Spanish Coffee again in a second as an after-dinner drink. It's coffee with orange and almond liqueurs protected by a carmelized-vanilla-sugar rim on the cup. The protection is applied at the table - in our case, since it was a new drink and since apparently not many Chicagoans smoke anymore, manager and waiter had to do some highly-involved searching for a match, involving mirth and merriment. And the drink was fabuLOUS. Hope it made it to the menu so you can get that. Baptiste and Bottle is wonderful. It's beautiful, warm and friendly, with great drinks, great food, great views and great service. You will enjoy yourself, and they will enjoy you being there.

Dan (the only Dan there) was the server and he recommended everything my friend and I had eaten, in addition to the drinks! There was a drink on the menu called Dealer's Roulette, which involves telling the \"dealer\" what type of taste or liquors interest you and he made me a bourbon drink similar to a Manhattan/Old Fashioned but with a bit of a twist with certain other flavors and it was exactly what I was looking for.

LET ME SAY - I take that back! A couple days after posting my review in late December, I was contacted by the manager of the restaurant and offered a complimentary meal for me and a friend as a \"second chance\" type of situation. I was hesitant to come back but did respond saying thank you and that I will come back someday (mostly because I didn't think they would actually comp my dinner and because I live about 45 minutes away in the suburbs). Two months went by and I ended up going back on 02/25/17, got seated and asked for the manager only to be told that the manager who promised me the comped meal actually quit that week. The waitress ended up speaking to the new manager and he did agree to comp the food. We ordered everything that was recommended, below are the reviews for each.1) Deep Fried Pickles & Wisconsin Cheese Curds - 9/10: Absolutely delicious, well crafted bar food with a tangy dipping sauce. 2) Bone Marrow + Oxtail Marmalade - 10/10: An array of flavor from every bite with impeccable freshness and attention to detail and freshly baked Texas toast squares.3) Whipped + Roasted Potatoes - 6/10: Creamy and delicious, a tad over salted.4) Brussels Sprouts + Pistachios - 7/10: Well roasted but a little fallen apart during the presentation which left the insides not as grilled as I would have prefered.5) Day Boat Scallops - 11/10: This was just everything, beautiful presentation, bright colored vegetables and melt-in-your-mouth scallops over a lightly sweetened, buttery sauce7) Triple Seared Prime New York Strip: 9/10: A tad above the medium grill I ordered but still delicious nonetheless. Came cut in evenly manicured slices over a bed of fresh veggies10) Sazerac - 8/10: Loved everything about this besides the (although minimal) use of rum11) South Side Mule - 10/10: The restaurant's own twist on a Moscow Mule and it was incredible especially with the use of Bourbon instead of the usual Vodka. Also comes in a pineapple shaped copper cup that is then used as its own drink stand (see picture).The entire experience was just phenomenal, special thanks to Aryonna (our waitress) for making this experience EXTRA awesome and thank you to Michael (the manager) for keeping the word of an ex-employee when he honestly didn't have to do anything.

I had someone at my door before I got a chance to step out of the car. She asked if I was a guest or if I was there dining with them. I had mentioned we were there for brunch. She quickly requested the valet driver to take our car and pointed us in the right direction to head to the 20th floor. We had been meeting a group for brunch for a friends birthday. We were seated at a high top able as soon as we walked in. Knowing we had a toddler with us, I'd hope they'd realize that's not smart nor safe. They weren't able to accommodate anything else. Before even taking off my coat, the waitress asked for my drink order. I told her I needed a minute to settle in and then can look at the menu. I wasn't being literal when I said a minute, but she was clearly counting down. I took off my coat and sat my son done, and she was standing with her pen and notepad. I told her to bring me a mimosa without even looking at the menu. I didn't appreciate the pressure. Once drinks were served, I then realized she was waiting on my husbands and my drink order to bring out everyone else's drinks (8 people), which I found silly. After nearly finishing out drinks, she came to take out order. I wasn't impressed with the menu, it's basically all breakfast meals with one steak and eggs option. Our table ordered various options. My husband ordered the lox dish, I ordered the waffle, a plate of fruit, and a side of fries. I explained that I'd be sharing with my son, so whatever was ready first just to bring out. As everyone knows dining with a toddler isn't always the most pleasant experience. Well dining with a hungry toddler is even worse! 3 snacks and 45mins later, the first dish comes out and it's my husbands lox dish. A few minutes later 2 more dishes come out, and shortly after a few more start trickling in. As of now, we are on dish 6, my husbands meal is cold waiting for everyone's to arrive, mine, nor my child's has arrived, and I've pretty much taken all the fries from my friends that ordered steak dishes. At this point no one is pleased. We asked to speak with a manager to address our concerns. He was very polite and apologized for the situation. He said that due to their errors, they will be covering a round of drinks and comping 3 meals that had failed to arrive until addressed, very kind. To cut to the chase, nothing was done, and we were over charged on items that weren't even ordered. It's actually pretty funny thinking about it now. As far as the food.... for some reason the side plate of fruit I ordered, ending up being served on top of my waffle, making it soggy instead of crispy. My husband enjoyed the lox plate, and my son loved his fries.... but then again, what 18m old doesn't love fries?! All in all, the experience was horrible. There was no service. The food, it was okay, not worth another trip back. If I happen to be in the area, and everything else is closed, I have venture out. Otherwise, they won't be seeing me again..."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4TjH7-Tq-HxVUgz38swgnA", "review_date": "11/26/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Erica B.", "review": "Such a delicious menu!We started with a Southside Mule and a pour of some Japanese whiskey that's hard to find in many restaurants...

Spectacular drink/cocktail menu complemented by highly skilled waitstaff and an expertly curated menu. Seemed to get really loud during peak hours which took a little away from the overall experience, but this could have been a one off as there was a party in the common area that had some pretty rowdy guests.Food: The big and small plate menu is the top notch and designed to complement the drinks. Top points for presentation. Highlights include the pimento cheese with radish starter (complimentary, but I would have paid for a gallon of that stuff) the cheddar and chive herb biscuit (up there with the best I've ever had), the dry boat scallops. Shout out to our server (older gentleman but can't remember the name) who's recommendations were on point!! Drink: This is where this establishment excels. An old fashioned is usually my baseline test, and I had high expectations here with their heavy emphasis on bourbon. Boy was I not disappointed! Special mentions also for the southside mule (the pineapple shaped cup is a great touch) as well as the dealer's roulette, where I trusted the bartender to whip up their own concoction after asking our server for something whiskey based. Again, testament to the expertise of both the server and the bartender.Ambience: Great view, comfortable seating, slightly dressy but in a good way. Can get quite loud as the dining room is not very sectioned from the bar area, so would keep that in mind if you are looking for something more intimate. Recommendations: Definitely recommended if you love bourbon and craft cocktails! Also cant seem to go wrong with most of the food menu.

The waiter consistently brought drinks, appetizers, and main courses to the wrong individual, seemed to disappear for most of our entire stay, and either forgot about some of the items we ordered or brought out the wrong dish.

We arrived for our reservation right on time and were seated promptly. Our server, Tom, greeted us immediately and explained the menu to us. The drink menu has a little something for everyone. We started with the La Dona and the Southside Mule. The mule came in one of those fun copper pineapples. For our second round of drinks we decided to go with the dealer's roulette. I chose to go with bourbon and my drink had an egg white with a light fruity flavor and it was exactly what I was looking for. There are a couple of drinks that are made table side. They wheel the drink cart over to you and explain what each ingredient is. Those drinks are $20, but it was cool to watch them being made. We picked out four dishes to try and then Tom convinced us to try the cheddar biscuit. I'm so glad he did because it was great! We also loved the spaetzle with duck confit and the bone marrow. The brussel sprouts were a nice vegetable dish for a side. We were sadly a little disappointed in the scallops. They were a little too salty for my taste.

Watching the bartenders whip up their unique creations was fascinating. The five of us shared everything and I will try to remember, in no particular order, what we tasted: Radishes with pimento cheese, cheddar biscuit, day boat scallops, bone marrow and oxtail marmalade (came with wonderful bread), brisket mac & cheese, squash and buratta, burger & fries, chicken with mole sauce, and whipped & roasted potatoes (combined in the same bowl). All items were beautifully presented. Everything was absolutely delicious. Two of my all-time favorites are A Great Burger and Scallops. Both were outstanding. But the surprise to me was the chicken with mole. Chicken is chicken, right? Not really too special? But this was cooked perfectly, not dry, colorful and with amazing mole (one of my favorites). Next time I come back I might order the chicken and not share with anyone. Our server, Marlene, was a delight. Many others who worked our table - terrific.

The food, the drinks, the service, the vibe, everything is on point. Ok so it's the morning after our dinner at Baptiste & Bottle and I'm still full. We literally had way too much to eat, but it was all so good and we didn't ever want it to end. Let's get to the fun stuff, the food and drinks. They have an extensive whiskey list, which right off the bat made me fall in love. I always like starting off with an Old Fashioned, but given it's a very whiskey influenced drink list, I let the waiter guide me to try something new. He suggested I try a table side cocktail, \"The Curtsy and a Bow\". Other than the Aviary, I've never had a table side cocktail, so I was excited to see what this consisted of. Another fun option on the menu was the \"Dealer's Roulette\", in which you pick a spirit and some flavors that you like and they come up with something around that. Anyways, a few moments later someone wheels over a long bar table and he introduces himself to us and starts talking us through the drink he's about to make. He made the experience super engaging and next thing you knew we had a beaker filled with dry ice adding an additional flavor to the drink he just made. So cool and definitely recommend trying the delicious drink out. The drink is tasty by itself, but the whole experience makes it a must. Now on to the food... Crudo - We've had amazing crudo across the country, but this was mind blowing. The flavors complemented each other perfectly and this is a must. Wow! Butternut Squash Soup - YUMMY! It was so damn good I wanted to start chugging it. Spaetzle & Duck Confit - Oh damn, the yumminess is not ending. Let's just say this is basically mac & cheese with a poached egg and duck. All those things combined make this dish so delicious. Charcuterie Board - Nailed it. A great mix of cheeses and meats. Day Boat Scallops - This is scallop perfection. I don't know if I can name a place that's had better scallops. Not only are they cooked perfectly, they're served with some amazing pur\u00e9e that adds another layer of flavor to the scallops. NY Strip - Again, they nailed it. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and sliced to perfection. I love steak like no other and this did not disappoint. If a restaurant has other steak options other than a NY Strip, I generally pick something else, but I'm glad they didn't or I would have missed out on this steak. It's served with roasted carrots, mushrooms and potatoes and it too was perfect. Roasted Brussel Sprouts - A solid brussel sprout side, exactly what you'd expect.Whipped & Roasted Potatoes - There has to be crack in these. It tasted like someone took a loaded baked potato and then whipped together in a blender. It's sooooooo good! Clearly we loved every single thing we had and we'll be raving about this place for a long time. We'll also be back often, it's truly one of the best restaurants we've been to in a while. It's clear that Baptiste & Bottle cares about every single detail of the restaurant: the ambiance, the drinks, the dishes, the glassware, the servers/service and definitely the food. You can tell there is thought put behind every dish and coupled with quality ingredients, you can't go wrong.

We honestly had a better experience sitting at the bar with the bar tenders trying different drinks than sitting down and eating for 2. Out of the 5-6 dishes we tried, the tagliatelle was the standout. Our scallops were cooked perfectly, but they are at many other places I've been to too. It was my friends birthday. Instead of brining out some cheap dessert they give to everyone that is celebrating something, they ask you to pick out what you want from the dessert menu. We did appreciate this gesture and more places should follow suit. The Cookie Batter dessert was tasty. Multiples chocolates without being too rich or filling is hard to do and this one fiit the bill. It was dark outside and dim inside so there wasn't much of a view to be seen. We also weren't seated at the window so that could have been part of why we didn't have that \"were sitting on the 20th floor\" feeling. I could see this being a great date place, make sure to sit a table by the window. I was with a GF so I didn't have that feeling here. I've heard brunch here is the way to go. I am tempted to go back for brunch before I completely decide on this place. I also have to say I thought this place would be more upscale and classy than the people we saw in it. We saw some people dressed more casual for a Saturday evening out (perhaps they were the tourists staying at the hotel). There were also a good amount of younger girls that were more dressed for a bar in Wicker Park than a classy dinner \"downtown.\" Or maybe its that I'm in my mid-30's and just don't know what it \"cool\" anymore ;)"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JSn1SMuy3jWHpG1Zfu8aAw", "review_date": "1/16/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "George B.", "review": "Excellent service, good food.

The hostess seated us right away even though we arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation. Had I know ahead of time that it was on the 20th floor I would have requested a seat by the window, but we had a great time regardless. The atmosphere was great as far as we were concerned, elegant and lively but still laid-back and quiet enough to easily carry a conversation. The interior is beautiful and the lighting was perfect, nice and dimmed but bright enough to read the menu and see each other. Our server, Marcus, was great. He had a ton of recommendations and walked us through the menu and drinks, and he was very attentive the entire evening. We started off with drinks. I ordered the \"locals flight\" of bourbon which was well present on a board with a little shot of prosseco for a palette cleanser. My wife ordered the Casper's Courage cocktail which she enjoyed very much. Their American whiskey prices seemed very reasonable with a slightly steeper markup for imports (guess that's expected). They had a pretty great looking cocktail menu which I would like to delve into on another occasion, especially testing the roulette option. Last but certainly not least, the food was excellent. The amuse bouche was tasty and interesting, and a welcome surprise. We started off with the cheddar chive biscuit which we both agreed was one of the best bread related items we've ever had (and my wife is quite the biscuit enthusiast). For mains I ordered the Amish Chicken, my wife got the burger, and we also went with the Brussels sprouts and the whipped potatoes. The chicken was awesome, perfectly cooked, and the mole and sweet potatoes were delicious and paired well. My wife was very happy with her burger, which included fries even though it didn't mention that in the menu. The Brussels sprouts were fantastically cooked and tasted delicious. The potatoes may have been the best I've ever had. Served in a good size bowl (would be madness to order for just one person) they were creamy and really tasty, especially with the fingerlings and crunchy jibjabs on top. At first I regretted ordering them because we simply had too much food but damn they were good. Even just knowing that potatoes can be that tasty was worth it. \u00a0The biscuit is big enough for two easily, and the entree portions were full-on main courses. For two people I'd recommend a starter (biscuit or a small plate), main/large plate each, and probably no more than one side. Overall we thought B&B was a great find and -- for Chicago at least -- a very moderate price given the quality of the atmosphere, service and food. I also appreciated that the bourbon theme, while still very noticeable, was not the least bit overdone or gimmicky. I would highly recommend it and definitely plan to return, it would even be a great spot for just drinks and a biscuit. Marcus also told us that next spring (2017) they will be opening a rooftop on the floor above which sounds awesome."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_g__auM5Y9NIt11PPERmcw", "review_date": "12/26/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Gus S.", "review": "Loved the food, drinks, and atmosphere.

And drinks were also amazing, get the one with the homemade fig!"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LEvR-Np9SlzgFT2OHx2q6g", "review_date": "2/17/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "alexandra k.", "review": "pros:- Extensive whiskey menu (but also offer cocktails/wine/beer)- staff friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about menu items- amuse bouche -- rum/cinnamon/tea concoction -- delish!- on the 20th fl just off Michigan, so had a table by the windows with a beautiful view!drink:I ordered the boat tour cocktail (it's hard for me to pass up a drink with grapefruit) -- tart balanced well with sweetness. \u00a0not worth the $13 price, but was good.food:we went with our server's recommendations:- cheddar and chives biscuit -- would recommend!balanced flavor, the cheddar and chives flavors are there but not overpowering, came out warm with honey butter with lemon zest- bone marrow with oxtail (this also came highly recommended by other yelpers) -- Not my favoriteI love bone marrow, but didn't like this version of it. \u00a0the marrow is scooped out, mixed with the oxtail, and then placed back into the marrow for presentation with a garnish of sauteed sweet peppers. \u00a0Maybe I'm a purist, but I couldn't taste the fatty richness of the marrow (which is why I love it so much!)- spaeztle with duck confit -- Good but not great.This came with a soft-boiled egg that they recommend to mix in for a rich sauce; also came with mushrooms and orange caviar for garnish. \u00a0The whole dish was..

For dinner, I had the scallops and my husband at a burger. \u00a0Everything we tried, was tasty, but not memorable (with the exception of that biscuit!). \u00a0Service: The service was slow from the get-go. \u00a0It took forever to place our drink order and our waiter was nowhere to be found when we wanted a second round. \u00a0When we finally ordered a second round, he dropped a tray of drinks down my back while trying to navigate to our table. \u00a0I totally understand that it was an accident. They were, no doubt, really apologetic. \u00a0However, they offered us a free round of drinks. \u00a0Instead of paying for the round that we had just ordered (and had spilled down my back), they brought us out a bottle of champagne that we didn't ask for, and frankly didn't really want. \u00a0Furthermore, they offered to pay for the dry cleaning of my wool coat, leather pants, and blouse - a generous offer, but there has been no follow through. \u00a0I submitted my receipt for reimbursement on Jan. 9th and I'm still waiting for a response, despite multiple emails. \u00a0Don't offer things up that you don't follow through on. \u00a0 \u00a0Overall, the experience was lackluster. \u00a0There are too many other restaurants with better food and customer service to come back here."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dT8_Z6su2X2cML2w33FTgQ", "review_date": "2/19/2017", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "user_name": "Carolyn B.", "review": "Was very excited to try something new. Loved what I saw in the pictures of it being dark place with table service of cocktails. That was a bit misleading as the place is pretty well lit and bottle service is only for the two most expensive drinks on the menu which are $25 each. The wait staff is very friendly and professional. The drinks are very good. The food however was a bit disappointing. Definitely skip the starters like the nuts and bacon and the pork rinds which are far too heavy to be eating prior to drinking. That kind of food just sits in your stomach and doesn't digest with alcohol. The scallops were good but not as presented in some of the photos that I saw.We were there on a Saturday night so you think they would have the best presentations put forward. My husband had a steak and shared some of that with me. So did one of our guest. One of their steaks was cold and the other was cool. They were served medium rare. There was quite a bit of fat and both. The atmosphere is nice and our view from the window was great. There's a lot of places to go to afterwards so the neighborhood location is a good one. The cauliflower soup was described by the person at our table as similar to eating lotion. It has a strange consistency. I love that they're trying to do something new but it just seem to miss the mark. Mashed potatoes are very good as was the brussels sprouts. A few more menu choices along with better starters would be great. The bill was $400 for 4 and would've expected more of an experience for the price."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=q5neQ0FajS_-bzBJjDKLhw", "review_date": "2/2/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Larry M.", "review": "Great cocktails and awesome views.

They serve amuse cocktails upon arrival, which was a nice surprise and the bartenders were really friendly. So all was good at that point, but then it took a good chunk of time to order cocktails and food, and then over an hour to be served our dinner once we ordered. By the time the food came, I had a hunger/alcohol headache after having only cocktails (I had been hungry upon arrival). We had to ask our waiter when dinner was coming out... there was no apology for it taking so long and no offering bread basket. All appetizers and entrees came out at the same time, which seemed odd. Dinner was good, the bison and eggplant were the only things I really enjoyed. My cocktail seemed watery, so I went to wine afterwards. I don't write many reviews, but the 4.5 star overall rating did not seem accurate to my friends and me, so I felt the need to share. Very cool space, so I hope the service improves!"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ys24etkWntaWLcxfA724oA", "review_date": "11/20/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Stacy R.", "review": "Really great dinner here Friday night with friends. I'm pregnant so I couldn't enjoy the cocktails but the cocktail cart looked fun and according to my friends were tasty. Scallops were the stand out for me followed by the buratta. We also had the Brussels sprouts, snapper, bone marrow, and biscuit which were all great. The service was great but the food came out slow to start...to be expected for a new opening. Towards the end of dinner my I felt my blood pressure drop and the room fade; luckily I was able to lay down in the plush booth like couch (very comfortable btw) and get some blood to my head to avoid full on fainting. The staff was attentive and showed genuine concern, even if they might have thought I was drunk at first. It was embarrassing for me, but they handled it well. Thank you to our waiter Eric! All and all,I thought the prices were really reasonable for the quality of food. I will def come back with my husband."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=GtjLM85OvYKnvhmWulsdNg", "review_date": "12/18/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Andy S.", "review": "Incredible meal and fantastic service!

We walked into a dimly lit, smooth, grey-colored, minimalist space with windows wrapped all around it, the Chicago skyline providing a perfect backdrop for the entire restaurant and the bar area. The music playing was soft and unobtrusive. Our cocktails and Koval Bourbon Whiskey on the rocks were delicious! Everything on the menu is great! But we especially enjoyed the Bone Marrow, the Cheddar and Chive Biscuit, and the Bison Carpaccio. The triple seared prime New York steak was superb and our wine was excellent! Above all, our server, Dan made our experience extraordinary. He was so very pleasant, amiable, professional, knowledgeable and attentive all evening that we decided to come back a week later and asked for him for a second time, only to experience yet another terrific dinner and a great breakfast the morning after. The hotel is also wonderful! Great, great experience, definitely to be repeated!"}]
