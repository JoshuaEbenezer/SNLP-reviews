"Great food and decor. The cocktails are unique and it's got a great atmosphere. Extensive whiskey selection. The eggs Benedict and the smoked salmon bagel are delicious brunch options.","3/26/2017","4.0 star rating","enXHgPR0iZbNDD-A0_b0Lg","Randy P."

"Really good meal here on a Saturday night.  Cocktails were delicious, probably had one or two too many.  Most of the food was fantastic - Carpaccio and Bone Marrow small plates cured my beef cravings, Brussels Sprouts and Chive Biscuit helped soak up the Bourbon.  By far the stand out was the jalapeno Mac and Cheese, we almost ordered a second helping even though we had way too much food.  Entrees were mostly on point, our table had the Bass, Bison, Scallops, and Strip.  Bison was a little cool when it made it to the table, and not as tender as I thought it was going to be.Real stars though were the service, and the drinks.  Our server Dan was fantastic, attentive, and helpful.  We will definitely be asking for him if we go there again.  We ended up getting a round of fancy drinks made with fog, and the roving drink cart bartender was a lot of fun as well.  Definitely a pricey night of food and drinks, but a great experience overall.","2/21/2017","4.0 star rating","xJ6Hy5QDqfqGdl0pkn0ong","Bart S."

"First time being here. Nice place for brunch. It's located in the conrad hotel. Nice ambiance when you come in. I loved the Bloody Mary bar and the Irish coffee was good but a tad bit strong. I got the special which was brisket with potatoes, mushrooms, and some other good stuff. The staff was great and super friendly. And their cinnamon rolls were BOMB. I think that it was a pretty dope spot, very nice and prices were reasonable. Good place to get brunch and definitely worth coming to check out!Best part is that I loved the mini hot sauces they give you!! Matter of fact I took one to go because they gave me two :D","1/22/2017","5.0 star rating","nUj8SnbW4maH9z2Udveqeg","Kristina F."
