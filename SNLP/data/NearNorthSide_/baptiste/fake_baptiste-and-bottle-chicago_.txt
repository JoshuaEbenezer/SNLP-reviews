Nice place for brunch. It's located in the conrad hotel. Nice ambiance when you come in. I loved the Bloody Mary bar and the Irish coffee was good but a tad bit strong. I got the special which was brisket with potatoes, mushrooms, and some other good stuff. The staff was great and super friendly. And their cinnamon rolls were BOMB. I think that it was a pretty dope spot, very nice and prices were reasonable. Good place to get brunch and definitely worth coming to check out!Best part is that I loved the mini hot sauces they give you!!
