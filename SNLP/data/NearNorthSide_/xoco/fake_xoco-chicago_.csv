"I must have eaten somewhere else than the other reviewers....I had a baha chicken torta and chips/salsa....the torta was mostly dry bread, very little sauce, and some poor quality chicken.  The fresh chips were not fresh and very bland, the salsas were really nothing to cheer about...mostly vinegar and a little spice. Diners eat at a ledge...not really even big enough to be considered a counter...most staring at a wall.  The only thing they had going for them was the reasonable price IF the food had been decent.  Chalk it up to lesson learned.","3/23/2017","1.0 star rating","_eJr8zTvAwOonMpgDcZJMQ","Laurie W."
"Staggeringly poor service and incompetence. Never wrote a Yelp review but this afternoon compelled me to sign up. I work across the street from this place and know the food is great but for the second time this month my food never showed up when I dined in. If you're going here with multiple people you've been warned. The refund happened after I waited 10 minutes for the cashiers and manager to figure out how to process a refund. In the end they gave me cash back because refunding a credit card wasn't happening. Never eating here again.","5/27/2016","1.0 star rating","dTbnY5n1cRPFiL2oXpdtqg","Steve R."
"My group and I have never experienced worse service at any restaurant anywhere in the world. If you want to be insulted by service staff, ignored, condescended to, while watching a  whole pack of lazy cooks standing around, playing with their phones, back-slapping and high-fiving while using their job to flirt with waitstaff and customers, then this is the place for you.We came for lunch in the middle of the week. There were all of 2 people in the restaurant. It was essentially dead. We placed our order at the counter for 6 pepitos (sandwiches) . 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 minutes passed. Not a single item came out. We counted literally 6 cooks standing behind the counter. The one cook who was apparently making our sandwiches didn't even start them until maybe 10 minutes after we ordered. No one was doing prep or anything during this time. Most were playing on their phones. When the cook who did ultimately start our sandwiches come out, he emerged from the bathroom, looked unclean, and proceeded to handle our sandwiches excessively with his bare hands as though he was playing with play-doh. One of my colleagues mentioned that he saw this cook in the bathroom when we came into the restaurant. I will not repeat what he was apparently doing.25 minutes into this ""experience"" (for sandwiches, no less), we asked the gentleman who appeared to be the chef how much longer it would be. This is downtown Chicago and most get an hour for lunch and of course it takes time to walk to and from work as well, so the time spent already was beyond absurd by any standards anywhere and especially for a massive cooking staff like this who were doing nothing. He shrugged dismissively and said, ""takes time"". We explained we ordered 25 minutes ago (and paid for it then, incidentally). He literally went over the cash register, said he was the ""chef"", looked at the register and said ""it only 17 minutes"". I said that was not true and showed him the time on my last phone call where I disconnected just prior to ordering (which at that point was 28 minutes in). He shrugged again and turned around.A person we thought was the host walked by and she was even more rude it turned out to be the manager and she was exceedingly rude and dismissive when we brought this to her attention. She also said, ""good food takes time"". That is beyond insulting. Setting aside that this was lunch, and rush hour lunch in downtown Chicago, and that we had merely ordered sandwiches, now half an hour into it to have her claim that there was some sort of snooty culinary magic going on requiring patience when she could see for herself that there were literally 6 cooks standing around literally doing nothing (and I mean nothing), is really insulting.The one cook (the one from the bathroom) who was then standing by the oven with tongs in one hand and phone in the other was glaring at us at that point to such extent that there was significant smoke coming out of the oven and the bread on one of our sandwiches was absolutely black and beyond charcoal burnt as in still smoking of burnt when he pulled it from the oven a good 30 seconds later. He proceeded serve the ruined sandwich with the others. We pointed this out to the manager. She denied it was burnt but at the same time refused to even look at it. We left without sandwiches and literally picked up sandwiches down the street (which took all of 5 minutes to prepare, at a fraction of Xoco's prices I might add). We left business cards and asked for Mr. Bayless to give us a call. We wanted to follow up and extend the courtesy of letting Mr. Bayless know what is going on under his name. No call came from Mr. Bayless a week later. I called again thinking the manager went out of her way to make sure the message didn't get through. This was confirmed when another manager, this time male, went out of his way to refuse to contact Mr. Bayless and was even more rude than the female manager. He claimed he looked into it, had a staff meeting and concluded we were ""crazy"" and it only took ""a few minutes and your sandwiches were ready for you"". I asked him to please review the video and offered to send him my phone logs. He confirmed to me through his response that this problem is systemic from the owner to manager to staff passed on down in stating, ""I don't need to review the video. Mr. Bayless does not care. You are crazy and I am too busy to speak with you as well."" He then hung up the phone.I write this review because I think yelpers are smart enough to draw their own conclusions as to whether or not this establishment warrants high ratings for overpriced Mexican food from a pretentious and insulting staff just because Rick Bayless' name is on the door. The consumer experience on the whole from sandwiches that are maybe 20% better than the average sandwich (at 3x the price) when even more offset against the wait times and slaps in the face from rude industry workers, renders the experience at Xoco one to skip, nay run, past.","4/6/2016","1.0 star rating","f0V_y3Yc82MMGgdUi04ctg","Maria H."

"I've been to XOCO 3 times, mostly because I tried to give it a chance (or two). I'm never coming back again.The food is subpar, because the ingredients do not taste fresh. Worse than an airplane meal. The chicken in the Baja Chicken sandwich was rubbery, tasteless, and smelt like it's been defrosted and reheated in a microwave oven. The Pozole soup smelt like someone scooped water out of the toilet. It may sound harsh, but I cannot justify paying 12 bucks for this food!I haven't tried the dessert (which may be great... who knows), but from my experience this place is an overhyped piece of garbage.","9/6/2014","1.0 star rating","N3-z2qit-Ij3LoggpzsN4Q","Alexander K."

"I had heard great things about XOCO so was thrilled when we decided to go there for lunch a few Saturday's ago.The line to get it was practically around the block but we decided to stay anyway.  The line moved quickly and once inside we entertained ourselves by figuring out what we would have for lunch.We ordered the guac combo for an appetizer and she ordered the ahogada while I ordered the carnitas.We were shown to a table and waited...  a long time.  The guac was fantastic.  We waited some more and finally the sandwiches showed up.  What a disappointment.  Dipping a sandwich into soup is just not working.  In addition, the sandwiches were nothing much.  But, at the suggestion of a neighbor we ordered the ice cream with bacon.That never showed up, even though we had paid for it ahead of time. It took over an hour for us to get hold of someone who would refund our money.I definitely will not go to XOCO again.  Too long a wait, food not good and service is lousy.","3/26/2014","1.0 star rating","6Z5ilboY62Ut0iGB1Fagsw","Ana B."

"Rick Bayless, I don't get it!  Went to Xoco right before lunch on a Saturday.  We had to wait to order tortas until 11:00, so we decided to have some chocolate and churros.  I also decided to have an empanada while waiting.  The chocolate with almond milk had a little too much almond flavoring in it, otherwise it was OK.  The empanda tasted Ok and would have been much better had it not been icy cold in the center.On to the tortas.  Ordered both a chicken and a short rib torta.  We were sitting right at the end of the serving line where the sous chef  gives the food to the servers.  Prior to recieving my torta my wife turned to me and said I was not going to like my order.  Just then the food arrived.  I looked down on my torta and it was not slightly burnt but black.  I looked at my wife and asked her how she knew.  She said she was watching our food come out and heard the server tell the sous chef that the sandwich was burnt.  The sous chef then turned the sandwich over and handed it to the server.Standing above the crowd is not what I would call Xoco.  For much less money I can go to any number of Mexican places in Chicago and get better food and better service.  The worst of it is I sent an e-mail with a picture of the burnt torta to the e-mail address on the website.  I am assuming that responding to customers concerns is not one of yours.","2/22/2010","1.0 star rating","a71BvyrYg3-Ll1qROXd1-g","Thomas S."
"Well, well, well Mr Bayless although it was wonderful to see you...happily posing for pictures and looking well I have to say I was not impressed!My Fiance and I are regulars at Frontera Grill, the waiters know our names! So of course when I read about Xoco I was highly enthusiastic and eager to get there immediately! We visited Saturday, their first since opening. The line was not as long as we'd anticipated...two blocks I'd read in some earlier reviews! We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes by an employee. A diner leaving told us we'd be waiting an hour, she was right! What I didn't read in the reviews before going was that the line also snakes around inside which took a further 25 minutes!I decided on the Cubana tortas until a member of staff informed those behind us it's really spicy so I settled on the Xoco salad. My partner choose the Gunthorp Chicken and Ahogada tortas. I also choose the churros as I'd never tried them, the Almendrado drink and choc/hazlenut cookie. You place your order, pay, receive a table number then seat yourself. (Any pastries are also given to you at this point) I knew it was going to be small but seriously unless you get a table by the front entrance then you have to eat off a 10 inch width of wood...yeh..not comfortable!My hot drink was brought over by a server, I regularly drink Almond milk in milkshakes so was looking forward to a sweet, smooth, creamy hot chocolate. I took three sips and left the rest. (not like me AT ALL)It was thick, clumpy, bitter, not enjoyable at all! My salad arrived. The pickled red onions...horrible. Chicken...really fatty tasting, sinewy and all dark meat. I thought 'fine I'll push the meat to the side and eat the salad leaves,' I couldn't even enjoy that. There was so much lime dressing on there, my salad leaves were sodden and tasted far too tart. The beans, I managed to find were..well they were beans! Not enough tortilla threads on there either. The only thing I enjoyed was my cookie and water. As your lining up you watch them bring the pastries out of the oven. The cookie was delicious although not enough nuts, too many choc chunks! I tried Churros for the first time...blah blah nah! Grease dripped on my silk dress, along with the copious amount of sugar. I was expecting them to be slightly more doughier not rods of crispy fried fat..which is what they were!My partner enjoyed his Ahogada, you can choose how spicy you have this. The broth was very tasty and the pork was really nice. The pork seemed to be a hit with many others whilst we were there. He didn't enjoy his Gunthorp Chicken and also commented on the fatty taste of the free range chicken. He said there wasn't nearly enough meat on the sandwich. The Sourdough bread was hollowed out which meant there was plenty of room for filling...so where was it? For those that have a sensitive roof (mouth) this bread is not a good idea.Overall we were both really, really disappointed and left there feeling sad, hungry and upset because we felt that we'd wasted $50. After so much hype, we felt Xoco doesn't live up to all the starred reviews on here. Whilst we are more than happy to get our regular spot at Frontera we shall certainly be in no rush to return here!","9/14/2009","1.0 star rating","YFXmlBIRD-6pORjJmSY7LA","Cookie S."
"I was very disappointed with the food especially being backed by Rick Bayless.  Although he projects an image of knowing great Mexican cuisine, he definitely missed the boat.  I was under the impression, wow an authentic Mexican restaurant NOT.  I know he likes to put his own spin on things, but the food was not good. Very American. The restaurant was crowded, but there must be a method to the madness because the staff was able to direct customers dining in and ordering in what looked like total chaos.  So if you want American food and not-so-Mexican, this is the place for you.  Adios.","5/12/2016","2.0 star rating","XSqFKHbPtlAvlhjI8v6L7Q","Kim G."

"I previously gave a 5 star review to Xoco but having gone back a few times recently, they have gone way down hill. The food takes forever to come out of the kitchen even if you are just ordering a sandwich. I watched people come in, place orders, wait, and two actually left disgusted because of how long it took. The prices here have also skyrocketed. This is Mexican food. There are no expensive ingredients. $12.00 for a Mexican sandwich that is skinny at best on ingredients and leaves you hungry is pretty outrageous. If you go to any other Mexican place in Chicago, you'll pay $6.00 for a burrito with 2-3x the ingredients and be very full. You'll also get your food fast and with a smile, unlike at Xoco.Pretentious, over-priced, and delayed food that is pretty much the same you get anywhere else for Mexican food in Chicago but without the fancy descriptions on the menu.","12/14/2015Updatedreview","2.0 star rating","ZvZZ0LF7AS3CjyjlC1SVvA","Kelly B."

"Bad Pozole.  Maybe the chef or kitchen had a bad day.  I've actually eaten their pozole before and I was pretty satisfied, but not this time.  I'm sure even Rick Bayless himself would have been displeased with the way his own dish tasted or was presented that day.  It's been a while since I had this dish and I've procrastinating to write this review, but what I remember the most about this dish was how salty it was and how the chicken pieces were presented.  I'll explain the chicken part.  Prior to this visit I've had the chicken pozole a few times and I remember the chicken being shredded and thus had a more appealing texture to it.  This time however, the chicken was very chewy and instead of shredded pieces, there were sliced cubes of chicken resembling those found in a can of Cambell's soup.  To be quite honest, it kind of grossed me out.  The presentation, texture, and saltiness of the plate was definitely not up to the standards of a place like this.  I didn't say anything to the manager because I rushed out due to another commitment, but I wished I had.  Will I return?  Maybe, but this time I may try something else.","4/11/2012","2.0 star rating","5tO4AonC4um9KqBbYtIx-Q","Jose D."

"I have to say that this place charges way to much for a sandwich/torta. I thought this was suppose to be like ""street food"". The torta I had was with pork, bacon and avocado and some over salty sauce which was all to salty, and the bread was 75% of the sandwich. REALLY! Its a simple sandwich and the brick oven is a gimmick. It would taste just the same in an oven or toaster oven. This place is for SUCKERS who fall for this rip off crap. Maybe some people feel better when they pay way too much, and therefore they think it tastes better. There is nothing special about this place. Its all a big HYPE! Do you believe in the hype? I sure hope not.","12/12/2009","2.0 star rating","K_JrX4Kf83lw4C3LF75zUw","Ryan S."

"Longest wait for food ever.  20 minutes to heat up an already made empanada?  The kitchen definitely needs some restructuring, as the two female cooks who handle the 4 hot items on the breakfast menu cannot handle reheating empanadas and bread pudding and constructing sandwiches.  I've worked in restaurants, I know that it can be hectic, but this is completely ridiculous.  The bad service is overshadowing the experience of the food.  I can't even imagine what it would be like to wait for lunch, and I probably will never go for lunch because of my negative experiences with breakfast.  It's disappointing to say the least.  I'm sure a lot of people were excited for this place to open; exactly what Chicago needs right now, but the service will definitely keep me from coming back.  The only employee that I've had a positive experience with is the cute pregnant girl at the register, she is a doll.","11/6/2009","2.0 star rating","oSr6TSV1R6ZSipVPP5YWfw","GIA T."
"I am a huge Rick Bayless fan, so it pains me to not give this place 5 stars.The overall dining experience was no fun.  You have to wait in line and you can't order until a table has been assigned to you.  Once you get a table assignment you order food, sit down, and wait for food delivery. It just seemed like a roundabout way of accomplishing the same task as a normal sit-down restaurant. Also, we did not have a private table -- my ""party of 2"" was joined by a ""party of 4"" at our six-seater table.  The food was decent, but the prices were high, especially considering the portion sizes.  The puny amount of salsa in the ""chips & salsa"" was so ridiculous that we laughed out loud.  Seriously, it was a total joke!  The chicken pozole soup was really good, but at $12 we felt it was overpriced.  The torta was just ok.We'll probably go back, but for a take-out lunch.  This place just wasn't what we were hoping for a Friday night out.","9/25/2009","2.0 star rating","ZMlmObrziPu-1fsYjiFn6Q","Meau S."

"We ended up being a bit disappointed with this place. We were excited to try the bean to cup cocoa, but ended up being rather disappointed because its flavor was pretty bland. We tried both the Mexico City Thick and the Authentic and both were rather disappointing. The Carnitas Caldo, however, was delicious. It was a bit spicy, but a great way to warm up when it's cold outside in Chicago. The seating is table sharing, so when it's busy, you WILL be seated with strangers. (I know for some people, that's not their bag.) It's a bit disappointing that you don't get some complimentary chips at your table.

I ordered and was shown to my seat, at a counter squeezed in between many others. Some seem to enjoy this kind of atmosphere, but it's just not for me.I had the Conchinta Pibil Torta. It was tasty, but a little too spicy for my liking. Unfortunately, the highlights of the meal for me were the chips & salsa & guacamole, which are all available next door at Frontera and Topo. The real star of the meal were the Churros.

Also, the ONLY vegetarian option is smokey and heavy on the mushrooms, so if you don't like that, there is nothing else for you to eat. The salsas were also too smoky for my taste because that's really all you end up tasting taking away from all the ingredients, and guac was nothing special.

"I am definitely a fan of Rick Bayless having watched his show ""Mexico One Plate at a Time"" as well as watching him compete on Top Chef Masters.  My review is based on my only visit so far and the one item I got which was the ""Wild Mushroom Torta"".  It's one of the vegetarian options and although I'm not totally vegetarian, I do like to incorporate vegetarian meals in my diet. The torta itself was a great idea although for my tastes I found it a bit too salty .  It came with some kind of crumbly goat cheese, and the wild mushrooms were also seasoned of course.  The baguette-type bread the torta came in was a little hard in texture also but I suppose this is needed so the entire sandwich doesn't become a soggy mess.  Overall though it was a little hard to eat and could get a bit messy (I ordered take-out and ate along the Riverwalk one Saturday morning.)The salsa was some type of red chili de arbol and while it went well with the Wild Mushroom Torta, it seemed to overpower it.  Overall with the Salsa, the Mushrooms, and the Goat (?) Cheese too too salty.  I will be going back at some point to try some of the other menu items.  I am nevertheless still a Bayless fan.  P.S.  Be prepared for a wait also.  This spot is incredibly popular.....","9/16/2012","3.0 star rating","kXW5xXtf1tyf5Wcch0BGFA","Adriel T."

"This place is good, but not exactly a huge fan. The price is a bit high relative to the service and quality of food. I would rather go to local restaurants and pay about half. Rick's flagship restaurant is damn good and worth every penny, but XOCO is simply nothing impressive. It's good food, but nothing impressive. This might have been like a hyped up movie... good, but didn't live up to the expectations.","7/31/2010","3.0 star rating","X0qeOfOWvhj8xA4DNrKYIQ","Megan S."

"To paraphrase a quote from lloyd bentsen; &#34;rick; i have served tortas.i currently live in las vegas which i consider to have some pretty good mexican food but this place takes the cake.we finished with churros with chocolate sauce.i came here for the dessert; specially the pistachio churro.amazing taste; amazing hot sauce; just a premo place to hangout and chow down.pretty awesome concept with uniquely delicious food and hospitality.might have spiked my blood sugar for the morning; but it was worth it.i heard this place can get pretty packed/busy during lunch on weekdays.definitely intense in flavor and very rich.i got there at 6pm on a weekday and there was no line whatsoever.","11/9/2016","4.0 star rating","HtQxVmeWk5Izppi9QpmRIQ","Zoe P."
"Too trendy, but solid meal. Can I get something better and cheaper up north, absolutely. But then it will not be Rick Bayless.The drinks are better than I thought.  The service could be a little better, but guess they are doing the best they can.","8/1/2016","4.0 star rating","vn3cSK67tCUm7f_c-srLlQ","Don M."
"I really enjoyed the chocolate espresso here. Really good flavours but the coffee could have been a bit stronger, but I'm not really complaining because the chocolate in it was exquisite(something that you can't find anywhere). There would be a downfall, this could be the space (a bit small). Sometimes it can get busy, so you have to wait, so avoid the rush hours. I'll be back for another wonderful experience.","6/30/2016","4.0 star rating","k6ALY6MXaYtuTk5Ht_N8IQ","Paul P."
"Nice fast and casual concept, good Mexican food, you can find some real traditional dishes like the torta ahogada ( original from Jalisco México ) A couple of salsas were served with chips both were pretty good, the green salsa was super fresh with a tangy flavor The app were excelente !! I really love guacamole with fresco cheese and pumping seeds it was GREAT !! I try The torta de milanesa as my main entree and It was ok, no complains about the flavor but the bread was more like a panini instead of a traditional torta.The service  was friendly but for a lunch visits I think the kitchen was a little on the slower side.The overall experience was really good, you definitely can tell when a place is different from the rest and I truly believe that here you can find some real and good Mexican Food.","5/24/2016","4.0 star rating","ryvIjP_LwVRc_TAvlQnAEw","Cesar V."
"I like this place this is my second visit.  Actually, I first had this, I was thinking to myself, where have you've been all my life. Probably, coz I don't even have a time to hang out in Clark. :D . Wow, food and service was so amazing. Dishes are cooked to perfection.  I got their CUBANA, and it's perfectly taste great! Food-at-its-best. XOCO is definitely a Gem of Chicago IL and lives up to the hype.","3/25/2016","4.0 star rating","QoDWWdU1dTnzBwdWjCPStg","Riley G."
"Xoco is an ideal spot to have quick takeout, and you're much more likely to get in here quickly than Frontera! Delicious sandwiches, soups, churros, and Mexican hot chocolate. I especially like this place in the late fall and winter - so comforting!","3/7/2016","4.0 star rating","0EjTKOm2eJAN9vTJUnereg","Paul B."

"This was delicious food. The place was cramped and busy, but I suppose that's a symptom of serving yummy food. My friend and I both had a sandwich that wer small but flavorful. I made sure to grab some churros to take home to my kids when the meal was over. Definitely recommended.","10/14/2015","4.0 star rating","jNe4bNuiMsrT44EPy5VEoA","Harold V."
