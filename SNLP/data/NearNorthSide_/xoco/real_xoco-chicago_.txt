We ordered a lot of food and everything was yummy at a great price!The first sign I saw when we walked in was 'Guacamole Bar' *Yea* we decided to order the Almost Naked Guacamole, made with roasted garlic tomatillos, as it was the original. By adding only homemade queso fresco , the tanginess really stood out with the fresh house made tortilla chips dusted with lime salt. The XOCO signature salad is a mixture of romaine and arugula, topped with black beans, avocado, onions, tortilla strips and a tart avocado-lime dressing. The salad was light and delicious and I'll be sure to order extra dressing because it is wonderful!The crispy Chicharrones were a delicate and airy treat topped with queso anejo, cilantro, and onions. I don't say this very often, but the side of tamazula hot sauce was almost too hot for me. So I'm glad it was on the side- the kick was powerful!The side of Oaxacan-style Peanuts came in a cute cellophane package; the seasoning of roasted garlic with lime and arbol chiles tasted just as it looked- spicy salty goodness!When it came to the Meal-In-A-Bowl Caldos, we decided on the slow-cooked pork carnitas. The broth was delightful, containing potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, arugula, and avocado. The dry ingredients were on the side so they didn't get soggy. The ratio of broth to product was perfect and I even dipped my portion of the tortas into the soup to sop up that mouth-watering broth. We ordered three styles of tortas for variety and each one had flavors that stood out on their own:The Cubana (from the griddle) had thick strips of bacon piled on smoked pork loin, topped with black beans, avocado, jack cheese, chipotle mustard, morita chiles, and a house made cilantro crema. It was smoky, creamy, and hearty. The Daily Special for Friday was the Smoky Garlic Shrimp. The seared, plump and juicy shrimp were smothered in chipotle-garlic mojo with arugula, black beans, onions, and goat cheese. Each bite was a harmonious blend and one ingredient never overpowered the others.The Woodland Mushroom (from the wood burning oven) was easily my favorite of the tortas. As the vegetarian option, it had meaty wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, black beans, arugula, goat cheese, housemade three-chile salsa, and a drizzle of olive oil. I savored Every. Single. Bite. and wished we had ordered two of them. We received extra tomatillo and three-chile salsas- much appreciated!I wanted to try the Xoco flan, but they were out, so I opted for the Tres Leches Cake as my birthday dessert. The pistachios and oranges were amazingly colorful and the bright spongy cake melted in my mouth. It was lovely to behold, had style, flavor, richness, and was easily shareable. The Mexican Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie was a good size with large chunks - delectable!Eating from Xoco was a wonderful experience for me and a great introduction to Mexican street food. I will be back to try the flan :)", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M6o_5diZgqzdswJnWZNKzg"}, {"review_date": "4/29/2017", "user_name": "Omar N.", "review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "Came here with my coworkers for lunch once because I had heard great things about this place.

Add a delicious chocolate flan, and my lunch was close to $20.. Don't know if the price point is worth the portion size, also including the \"panera\" fast food atmosphere.

They feature sandwiches, sides, and desserts plus Margaritas. A remarkable place for unbelievable authentic Mexican food.If you are coming for lunch, get here early if you can. The line grows fast. You essentially order at a counter and then find a table or bar counter. \u00a0They will bring your order to you. \u00a0The service is very attentive. The staff is welcoming and regularly checking with you to ensure you have what you need.I usually order guacamole fully dressed which comes with spicy roasted poblano, chicharr\u00f3n (crispy fried pork skin), grilled onion, smoky bacon, local tomatoes, queso fresco (fresh cheese), pumpkin seeds, minus the pumpkin seeds LOL. The guacamole is refreshingly fresh and creamy.I essentially come here for the tortas. I always say next time I'll get tacos, but I keep coming back to the tortas. The quality of the food is as respectable as any upscale restaurant. I've tried several of the tortas and these are ones I keep ordering again and again.AHOGADA - pork carnitas, black beans, tomato-Arbol chile broth, pickled onions. This is by far my favorite torta. The presentation alone is worth ordering, the two halves standing on end in a bowl of tomato-based goodness. The levels of flavor are heavenly.COCHINITA PIBIL - Wood-roasted Gunthorp suckling pig, achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero. You can never go wrong with suckling pig! LOL. This sandwich is another amazing Rick Bayless masterpiece.CHIPOTLE SHRIMP - Mexican blue shrimp, avocado-tomatillo salsa, local artisan Jack, pickled Manzano chiles, arugula. If you're lucky enough to be in Chicago on a Friday, you must try the daily special. This torta is bright and fresh with incredible flavor.GOAT BARBACOA - braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions, cilantro. Another daily special for Saturday, but the braised goat is so enjoyable.I highly recommend coming to Xoco, the food is unbelievably awesome. Xoco is by far the best Mexican food I've had from a place that is basically a fast-food restaurant. It's a must stop for me whenever I'm in Chicago.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nT5usSDYKPL8wJu4zcm8jw"}, {"review_date": "4/1/2017", "user_name": "Abby T.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Ordered the chicken tinga and the spare rib tacos. For $12-$13 for four tacos, it's a pretty decent price. The tacos were juicy and tender. The avocado slice in each taco gave it a creamy texture offsetting the meatiness of the taco. The spicy sauce that came with it was very tasty (and I normally hate spicy sauces). The churro was delicious. Definitely get the chocolate shot to dip the churro. Not the softest churro but still great.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=etNQ48VMk-5pX60cuAqs8w"}, {"review_date": "3/6/2017", "user_name": "John K.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Xoco is the most reasonably priced, laid back and casual restaurant of Rick Bayless's Chicago outposts. The menu here is composed of mostly Mexican sandwiches, soups, and snacks as well as some breakfast options and a few cocktails. A great place to come for a unique lunch.Located in Chicago's bustling downtown River North area on the same block as two of Bayless's other more upscale dining locations (Topolobampo and Frontera Grill). You walk in and hop into line which was short when I arrived around 11:30 AM on a thursday in July but grew tremendously fast thereafter. After ordering you retreat to a table or counter stool of your choice with your drinks and your food will be brought out and delivered to you soon after. Note that if you order an oven roasted sandwich like I did it will take about 15 minutes to come out.For my food I of course had to order the churros with housemade chocolate for dipping since they get constant rave reviews and always make the list of top foods to try in Chicago. I also went with the Thursday specialty shortrib sandwich for my main course. The churros and chocolate were pretty good but nothing out of this world. The shortrib sandwich was very good and came with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The sandwich came loaded with black beans, cactus salad, and avocado which made for a delicious, flavorful, and unique blend of flavors. For a drink I ordered the Mezcal Fresco which tasted a bit watered down and was small for the cost of $11.Overall I totally recommend this place as a really nice and reasonably priced lunch spot for a unique Mexican meal prepared by people who know what they're doing when it comes to Mexican cooking. I would also recommend skipping the cocktails and getting here by 11:30 AM or be prepared for a long line.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ozVlStttOsOZ7TqJIxGq8A"}, {"review_date": "3/2/2017", "user_name": "Brittany S.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "After a recent visit to Madrid I've kept my eyes open for churro con chocolate options stateside. \u00a0Boom! Xoco was conveniently located a few blocks from my hotel in Chicago. Thank you, Yelpers. I'm a huge fan of Bayless' work - be it restaurants or his PBS show. This business is a great extension of his farm to table focus with greens grown in his backyard and meat sourced from Gunthorp Farms in northern Indiana. As you wind your way through the ordering line at Xoco you can read about where the ingredients are sourced and see the cuisine being made before your eyes (beautiful open kitchen with a window overlooking the sidewalk). The menu is fast casual with an emphasis on high quality ingredients. As for the churro, they offer a classic churro con chocolat as well dipped options like pistachio and chocolate and peanut butter. I opted for the dipped chocolate peanut butter. I so wish I could have given this experience five stars but the churro seemed to have been fried in the same oil as other dishes for the restaurant (savory dishes). In the end it tasted too oily and tortilla-ish. It seems like this would be an easy fix or maybe someone accidentally fried it in the wrong spot? :/ I will definitely return for the savory options. The environment and price are also worthy of a return visit.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g"}, {"review_date": "4/21/2017", "user_name": "Billy L.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "I was in Chicago for a vacation and we felt like Mexican food so after reading some reviews of a few places we settled on this restaurant and were very glad we did.

But I have my favorites.My top 3 are the Baja Chicken, the Choriqueso, and the Goat Barbacoa (the Saturday special).The Baja Chicken is a delicious chicken sandwich. Unlike many of the other tortas, this one isn't as greasy. When I come here with a friend and we decide to split the tortas (they're cut in half) I always make sure one of us order this one. Sometimes you need something to offset all oil. And this sandwich satisfies that need while tasting insanely delicious.The Choriqueso is a delicious, greasy, chorizo filled sandwich. You shouldn't even smell this sandwich if you're on a diet. But all the chorizo is definitely worth it. This sandwich just melts in your mouth and you definitely appreciate the structure of the bread. The bread seems a bit of an overkill for most of their sandwiches but for the Choriqueso it is a necessity because the grease just gets absorbed. And you still have a sandwich, not a mess.The Goat Barbacoa is delicious and I'm sad it's only available on Saturdays. As such, I've only had it a few times but it's wormed it's way into my heart by satisfying my stomach. The braised goat just melts in your mouth. Other things I recommend are the guacamole and their margaritas. Just spend the 8 dollars to get all the toppings on the guacamole. And the margaritas are just delicious.

I expected some decent Mexican fare but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I was just hungry and in some desperate need for something to satisfy my hunger pains.Stepping inside, the hostess was very friendly and helpful. She gave us menus to peruse and once we found some items to our liking, she directed us to the cashier after assigning us a table number. The cashier will ask for your table number with your order. We ordered the carnitas tacos and the vegetable caldo (meal-in-a-bowl soup). They have a machine that dispenses both regular water and sparkling water, with glasses available on the side so you don't need to ask them for any. Once we were done ordering and getting our waters, the hostess showed us to our table. Not too long afterwards, our food came. We got four carnitas tacos ($12). The tacos have guacamole, onions, and cilantro. They were really good and flavorful. I gobbled my tacos and instantly wanted more. The real winner of the meal, however, was the caldo. Typically, I don't order veggie soups at restaurants since they're usually bland and devoid of ingredients. This veggie soup, however, was fantastic. It had black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, potato-masa dumplings, avocado, serrano chile, and other greens. All for $10.50. It was very filling, and it tasted so, so good. I was very surprised at how hearty and delicious this caldo was. It really is a meal in a bowl of soup. The perfect dish for a cold day in the Windy City. I would absolutely come here again.

The smoky chipotle really set it off though, it brought this warmth and, well, smoke that just made it so good. Not really much heat either. The Aztec chocolate is what I really fell in love with though. It comes out piping hot, so take a second before downing it. Smooth chocolate, with warming chile and a touch of sweet allspice. I died.

I was excited to check this place out as this place has been on my list of restaurants to try. Parking: there's paid street parking on nearby streets. We parked by RPM Italian which was across the street. The restaurant is located on a corner. We kinda got lost looking for the entrance and almost ended up going to an apartment complex but found the entrance when people were leaving with their to go lunches.You walk into the restaurant, and the hostess gives you a menu so you can look at what you want to order. There's also a menu on the wall. There's two lines, one for take out and one for dine in. You order the food at the counter, the person at the counter will assign you a table number, then the waiter will guide you to your table. Food: I ordered the ahogada torta ($11), which is one of the more popular items on the menu. It has pork carnitas with pickled onions and it sits in a chile broth. You can choose your spice level and I chose mild but it was a little spicy for me. I wish the bread wasn't soggy because I like my sandwiches dry. I usually don't like dipping my sandwiches in sauce (like French Dip in Au Jus or Italian Beef) but I appreciate that the sandwich was flavorful with the onions and chile broth and that the pork was tender. \u00a0My dad ordered the seafood caldo, or soup, ($13) with shrimp, catfish, mussels, cilantro, and lime in chile broth. He liked his soup but he wished he had rice with it to make it more filling. (we're Asian, we eat rice with everything!) We also had chips with tomatillo and 3 chile salsa. The chips had a hint of lime flavor and I preferred the 3 chile (green) salsa over the tomatillo (red) salsa.For drinks, I tasted the Authentic Hot Chocolate ($3), which had ground chocolate and water and my dad had the agua fresca ($3), agua del dia (water of the day), Raspberry Lime. My hot chocolate was rich but a little bitter, it tasted like dark chocolate. It took some getting used to but I ended up liking the bitter taste. My dad liked his Raspberry Lime agua fresca, though it was more on the lime-y side. As for dessert, we had the pistachio, hazelnut, and original plain churro with the chocolate dipping sauce on the side. Of all the churros, the pistachio had the best flavor and I recommend ordering that one if you had to choose a flavor. The churros tasted like donuts and were not greasy. The glazed (pistachio, hazelnut) churros are $2.25 each while the plain ones are $1.60 plus the chocolate dipping sauce on the side is $1.25.I wish the prices weren't Top Chef prices ($11 sandwich, $13 soup, total for food and drinks was $36 plus $8 for desserts) but the food was enjoyable and it was good! It wasn't amazing but I was glad to try something different! Verdict: My dad and I enjoyed our food but not sure if we are coming back due to the price of the food.

I will come back just for that! \u00a0Our lunch was a great 4 star. \u00a0Possibly a 5 star. \u00a0Don't get the Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk)... it was undrinkable and sour.This is the 4th Rick Bayless establishment I've been to and I would say this is my favourite so far. \u00a0Better than Lena Brava! \u00a0I love it for the service (those hostess have memories like an elephant and they manage the place so well) and the flavours. \u00a0Flavours are great here. \u00a0This is an interesting concept as it is a true fast casual restaurant. \u00a0They do offer table service but you do line up to place your order. \u00a0We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was completely packed. \u00a0They do pace the ordering so your table is available right after you order. \u00a0I do appreciate how it's not a free for all where people are jostling each other to get a table.For $40 lunch, we got the Friday Chipotle Shrimp Torta, seasonal Sweet potato caldos, their new hot chocolate with almond milk, and 3 fresh churros with the chocolate on the side. \u00a0Seeing how cold it was, I was going to get a soup for sure. \u00a0It took about 15 minutes for our meal to arrive after ordering which is pretty good seeing how crazy busy they were. \u00a0I appreciated how the staff here is constantly cleaning and making sure everything is being delivered super fast. \u00a0The Chipotle Shrimp Torta was incredibly well done... the shrimp had a nice heat and not overcooked. \u00a0I had to fight for a bite to try it. \u00a0My vegetable soup was good... I loved the heat and flavour of the vegetable broth. \u00a0The one comment I had about mine was that it was 80% shredded cabbage with only 3 potato dumpling and 2 pieces of sweet potato. \u00a0I was thinking I would have more variety than one vegetable. The broth was very good though so I was able to kinda overlook the lack of good vegetables. \u00a0The unfortunate part of the meal was the \u00a0Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk) .. it was actually quite sour. \u00a0We left the drink more than half full. \u00a0The best part of our meal (and possibly best I've ever had) was the churros. \u00a0We got 3 churros with the chocolate on the. \u00a0WOW. \u00a0Hot crispy exterior that had a great crunch when you bite into it with an airy and light interior. \u00a0The best doughnut ... even the dough had a nice flavour. \u00a0The sugar coating wasnt too much to be too sweet. \u00a0The chocolate shot was incredible ... deep dark chocolate flavour without it being too sugary and perfectly complimented the churros. \u00a0This is also we had an issue with the hot chocolate as it is supposed to be the same chocolate shot ... we practically licked the last bit of the chocolate.Overall, I'm definitely coming back for the churros but I'm also willing to try other items on the list. \u00a0Service is fast and smart and though it is packed, they move tables quickly. \u00a0Great flavours and my favourite Rick Bayless restaurant so far!", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA"}, {"review_date": "5/13/2016", "user_name": "Nique F.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Big fan! Wish they had Xoco back home, I'd be a regular for lunch or dinner. It's an interesting fast casual meets waiter service hybrid. As soon as you enter, they assign you a table, so after you've ordered your food at the counter, there's a table waiting for you. Love this little touch, as I often suffer from table-snagging anxiety. LOVED the Oaxacan menu, just different enough from run-of-the-mill Mexican, but still familiar and comforting with all those spicy flavors. I had the pozole soup, a meal-sized bowl, pleasantly too big to finish. For dessert, the Oaxacan chocolate soft serve with cajeta sauce and chocolate crumbles. Cool that they serve beer, wine, and cocktails on tap - keeping with the \"fast\" casual theme.

We came on a weekday evening and had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table for a party of 5 even though we kind of beat the rush. You wait in line and are given a table number. You then place your order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. They will hold dessert until you've finished up your entree. We had the ahogada and pork belly noodle soup. The ahogada is a pork sandwich that is placed in a bowl of thick tomato based soup. Presentation is beautiful but the mixture of flavors were a little weird for me. It could also be that I don't like soggy sandwiches and would have preferred to have the sandwich and sauce/soup separate. The pork belly soup has pork belly, mushroom, avocado, zucchini, and some bitter greens. The salsa negra is a spicy hoisin sauce. For people familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a Spanish American version of \"bun bo hue\" or spicy beef noodle soup. The dish is ok but I think it could use more noodles and less of the greens because of the bitter taste. The thing that really killed this dish for me was that I found a dead BUG in the soup. However, the manager of the store dealt with it very professionally. They offered to replace my meal and also excluded it from our bill. For dessert, we had the churros with ice cream and hot chocolate. They are known for their bean to cup chocolate. The hot chocolate is rich and somewhat bitter. I don't usually drink hot chocolate so I can't really compare it to anything. I am a huge fan of dark chocolate but didn't like the bitter or unsweet taste of the hot chocolate. The churros were warm, crispy, and good. The ice cream must be made with the same chocolate because it was also slightly bitter. I love churros and ice cream but the two didn't really go very well together. I mistakenly thought it would since the ice cream was listed as an add on to the churro. Ambiance of the restaurant is trendy, loud, and kind of tight. It is not family unfriendly but probably not the best spot for young kids.

I loved the potatoes and brussels sprouts that were in the soup. The soup was a little on the saltier side as well. I think a piece of bread, some avocado chunks, and some cilantro would've been a perfect accompaniment to the soup to offset the saltiness. Definitely have to get a churro. The pistachio glazed churro was not too sweet and the churro was so crispy and soft in the inside. It comes with a generous amount of crushed pistachios and glaze.

Upon seeing the building you can witness the baking area and kitchen from the window which is very cool. They also have an eating area outside incase they are packed indoors. My wife and I stopped by Friday night about an hour before closing. We were concerned about the quality of food due to us showing up at this time. Once we entered we really didn't know how everything worked. So I spoke to someone who was helping another customer, and they got me in touch with the hostess. While in line to order she gave us a table number and we placed our order with a really nice young lady. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had a great personality. Our food choices are below. Chips & Salsa + Guac: The chips were freaking delicious. The texture and crunch was nice. With the chips we received a green and red salsa. Both were slightly different in flavor and not spicy at all. I'm sure they have spicier salsa but we didn't really check. Now the Guac, oh man. Not only is there fresh made Guac, they had a variety of things that enhanced the flavor. You had queso fresco, onions, tomatoes, and much more. You could also get I believe bacon as well but we do not eat pork. Pepido Torta: This is a Hispanic sandwich and there are usually several versions. This one was made of short rib meat and basically looked like barbacoa. The bread of the sandwich was a little too crunchy for my liking. The beef was delicious and the toppings were minimal and complimented each other very very well. Churros w/chocolate sauce: Let's put it this way, I ordered this for myself and had to split half with my wife. These churros were warm and the chocolate sauce tasted amazing. I was basically dipping the churro and trying to get as much sauce on it to eat. The crunch and softness was very well balanced. Cuatro Leches Cake: Traditionally we see this cake wet and with a layer of sauce at the base. This was different and delicious. We would come back here again next time we visit for sure.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RhqdO0R_Cof__YYPsSRcSQ"}, {"review_date": "4/1/2017", "user_name": "Jason D.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "The torta Cubana is sublime!

Xoco is short for chocolate, in case you didn't make that connection (like me)I was sold on the Chorizo Empanada from looking at the menu online, but torn between the chocolate Cappuccino and the Authentic. When I asked the cashier what she recommended, she said the Cappuccino but gave me a small sample of the Authentic to try too!You order at the front, are given a number, and then sit at the table associated with your number. So although there were plenty of seats available, we were assigned to sit on bar stools next to the front door. The hostess that helped us find our seat was very friendly, felt like she was welcoming us into her home (if her home was a Chipotle?). The busboy checked in frequently to take any dishes we had finished.I didn't so much like my Empanada, it had too many spices (not like spicy, but too heavy on the cumin/chili powder). I tried to make do by dousing it with salsa. My boyfriend had ordered the steak and egg torta and was willing to share so I traded him halfway through. We both liked the drinks but felt like they were a little too sweet-- particularly the chocolate that sank to the bottom on both. Oh, and we got a chocolate churro to share too.

When you eschew \u00a0the traditional bread from a Mexican torta and replace it with a baguette-even a tasty one-it turns into something other than a torta. And when you make churros really skinny they get tough. And when you cover them with sauce they get tough and soggy.That said, most of the flavors I had were very good ones. And the habanero salsa that came with the sandwich had a wonderful flavor, although it was really too hot to eat, as I was warned.So if you want something different, you might try it, but if you want a tasty Mexican lunch, look for the little food counter at the back of most Mexican grocery stores.

It was Cinco de Mayo and we wanted some Mexican food and margaritas. My husband and I were thinking of going to our usual taco place on Ashland and Chicago, but were pretty sure they didn't' serve margaritas. We were walking home from work and stopped by Mercadito but they didn't have any tables until almost 9 pm. Then we walked and saw Xoco and figured we'd give that a shot. We each got 2 margaritas, naked guac, coctel rojo (seafood cocktail), seafood caldo (soup), and the seasonal pork loin sandwich. The bill after tip was 84. Guac- Fine. Not any better than whole foods/chipotle guac Chips- fineCoctel rojo- The sauce was very tasty. It was almost sweet/tangy but spicy at the same time. The shrimp/scallops were fresh. This came with a ton of chips. Between the chips that came with this and the chips that came with our guac, we had more than enough chips.Salsas- Good. I know these salsa are popular but I like pico de gallo and chunkier salsas with chipsSeafood Caldo- lacking in flavor. The seafood was very fresh, but the broth needed something. It was such a bright red broth that I was thinking it would be packed with heat/flavor, but there wasn't much.Pork Loin sandwich- this was very tasty. We enjoyed this. The meat was well marinated and the cheese complemented it well.Margaritas- okay. for 10 dollars, I was underwhelmed. They were small, barely cold, not much salt on the rim. We should have gone to our normal hole in the wall and just had drinks at home. However, we were in the mood to go out and enjoy the nice weather. We had fun and the food wasn't bad. However, for 80 bucks, I feel like it should have been better.

This place is pretty casual. You order at the counter and your order is delivered to your table. Although the line was a little long when we arrived, it went pretty quick. My husband and I split an order of guac. We went with the \"almost naked\": roasted garlic-tomatillo guacamole with choice of two toppings (our choice was queso fresco & poblano), tomatillo salsa, three-chile salsa, just-made chips. I'm a guacamole-aholic and this was excellent guac!! We also split one of the tortas. We ordered the Cochinita Pibil torta: wood-roasted Gunthorp suckling pig, achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero. That habanero salsa that comes on the side is fire! I mean it will leave you feeling like you are on fire. Soooo spicy! I was very conservative with it but my husband went all in and he was sweating from the heat! Luckily we had delicious xoco margaritas to cool us off. The margaritas were also excellent. They are made with Milagro blanco tequila, Combier, fresh lime & cucumber, homemade lime bitters.

My wife and I split an order of the sikil pak (kind of an Aztec-y hummus made with pumpkin seeds and tomatoes) that came with cucumber and jicama sticks and chips which was soooooooo good. Really a perfect starter and maybe healthy? I'm treating it as healthy since I mostly stuck to vegetables/licking the bowl. Sandwiches (tortas) came out next and we were impressed all over again. I had the ahogada which came drowned in a bowl of spicy soup (there were three spice-level options but to be honest the \"spicy\" wasn't that spicy. I can't imagine what the others must be like) and my wife had the sandwich of the day which was carne asada. Both were good but mine was Great (sorry, babe). The torta ahogada is the kind of sandwich that makes you get philosophical about sandwiches can be. The particular sandwich ended up being a pretty great soup in the end too, as I was losing a few bits of the pork into the dipping bowl every time the bread lost it's structural integrity. We finished off the meal with a stunning hot chocolate that I'm calling the best I've ever had even though my wife says it's not a fair competition. My biggest regret is that my wife didn't order dessert for herself that I could try because the churros look incredible.

Fortunately, xoco fills your torta with great combinations of meats, veggies, and sauces.The ahogada is the best sandwich on their menu, but if it's saturday, you should probably take advantage of the goat barbacoa - the sandwich of the day.Don't forget about breakfast either! Holy crap there's so much good stuff before 10am.

And churros. They have churros. I mean, come on, didn't you see this solid 4 star review coming from a mile away? So, yes, Bayless did just dandy when it comes to all things Xoco. I love the concept - fresh Mexican (street eats) that lean towards the more casual tortas, guac, soups, etc, all made quickly and perfect for takeaway. All that being said, my buddy Corey and I still sat inside and enjoyed our lunch. First of all, the naked guac was pretty fabulous - incredibly fresh and flavorful and perfect with my fresh juice. However full you may be, start with some guac, my friends. When it comes to the menu, I've got to be honest, I wasn't totally bowled over by my main order - the ahogada. I should have read the description closer as the sandwich comes with a *very* spicy broth and not only am I not crazy about dipped sandwiches in general, but more so, my mouth was absolutely on fire. And I can handle heat. So there's that.Even though the sammie wasn't my fave, the grilled pork was flavorful and delicious, and everything I sampled was super solid. I'm looking forward to my Xoco visit and getting through more of the menu!

(3.5 stars)Goat Barbacoa sandwich tasted bland. \u00a0From the bread to the goat meat, it was disappointing. (2 stars)Ahogada sandwich tasted better than the Goat Barbacoa. \u00a0Everything about it was quite flavorful. \u00a0Disappointed, though, that it did not taste as satisfying as my hometown food truck/trailer. \u00a0No \"Wow\" factor! \u00a0(3 stars)Glazed Churros were delicious! \u00a0The Hazelnut and the Pistachio churros did meet my expectations! \u00a0The best churros that I have ever eaten. \u00a0I would return for those sweet treats! \u00a0(5 stars)As I mentioned earlier, Xoco did not meet our expectations. \u00a0If I lived in Chicago, then I would try their sandwiches again cause maybe their chefs that day were having an off day. \u00a0As a tourist, I would not dine here again because there are so many restaurants yet to try. \u00a0Correction, I would return for their Hazelnut and/or Pistachio glazed churros. :)", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg"}, {"review_date": "2/19/2017", "user_name": "Dan Q.", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Really good sandwiches. \u00a0Great Margaritas. \u00a0Wish they had a larger space so people didn't get stuck in line for so long before getting to sit.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hydFwqWlPCBxWn9z2q0rpg"}, {"review_date": "9/9/2016", "user_name": "Joe J.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Pro tips from a 2nd time visitor: You should order the espresso, it's good.
