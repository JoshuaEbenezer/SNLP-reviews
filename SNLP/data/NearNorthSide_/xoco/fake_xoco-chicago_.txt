If you want to be insulted by service staff, ignored, condescended to, while watching a \u00a0whole pack of lazy cooks standing around, playing with their phones, back-slapping and high-fiving while using their job to flirt with waitstaff and customers, then this is the place for you.We came for lunch in the middle of the week. There were all of 2 people in the restaurant. It was essentially dead. We placed our order at the counter for 6 pepitos (sandwiches) . 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 minutes passed. Not a single item came out. We counted literally 6 cooks standing behind the counter. The one cook who was apparently making our sandwiches didn't even start them until maybe 10 minutes after we ordered. No one was doing prep or anything during this time. Most were playing on their phones. When the cook who did ultimately start our sandwiches come out, he emerged from the bathroom, looked unclean, and proceeded to handle our sandwiches excessively with his bare hands as though he was playing with play-doh. One of my colleagues mentioned that he saw this cook in the bathroom when we came into the restaurant. I will not repeat what he was apparently doing.25 minutes into this \"experience\" (for sandwiches, no less), we asked the gentleman who appeared to be the chef how much longer it would be. This is downtown Chicago and most get an hour for lunch and of course it takes time to walk to and from work as well, so the time spent already was beyond absurd by any standards anywhere and especially for a massive cooking staff like this who were doing nothing. He shrugged dismissively and said, \"takes time\". We explained we ordered 25 minutes ago (and paid for it then, incidentally). He literally went over the cash register, said he was the \"chef\", looked at the register and said \"it only 17 minutes\". I said that was not true and showed him the time on my last phone call where I disconnected just prior to ordering (which at that point was 28 minutes in). He shrugged again and turned around.A person we thought was the host walked by and she was even more rude it turned out to be the manager and she was exceedingly rude and dismissive when we brought this to her attention. She also said, \"good food takes time\". That is beyond insulting. Setting aside that this was lunch, and rush hour lunch in downtown Chicago, and that we had merely ordered sandwiches, now half an hour into it to have her claim that there was some sort of snooty culinary magic going on requiring patience when she could see for herself that there were literally 6 cooks standing around literally doing nothing (and I mean nothing), is really insulting.The one cook (the one from the bathroom) who was then standing by the oven with tongs in one hand and phone in the other was glaring at us at that point to such extent that there was significant smoke coming out of the oven and the bread on one of our sandwiches was absolutely black and beyond charcoal burnt as in still smoking of burnt when he pulled it from the oven a good 30 seconds later. He proceeded serve the ruined sandwich with the others. We pointed this out to the manager. She denied it was burnt but at the same time refused to even look at it. We left without sandwiches and literally picked up sandwiches down the street (which took all of 5 minutes to prepare, at a fraction of Xoco's prices I might add). We left business cards and asked for Mr. Bayless to give us a call. We wanted to follow up and extend the courtesy of letting Mr. Bayless know what is going on under his name. No call came from Mr. Bayless a week later. I called again thinking the manager went out of her way to make sure the message didn't get through. This was confirmed when another manager, this time male, went out of his way to refuse to contact Mr. Bayless and was even more rude than the female manager. He claimed he looked into it, had a staff meeting and concluded we were \"crazy\" and it only took \"a few minutes and your sandwiches were ready for you\". I asked him to please review the video and offered to send him my phone logs. He confirmed to me through his response that this problem is systemic from the owner to manager to staff passed on down in stating, \"I don't need to review the video. Mr. Bayless does not care. You are crazy and I am too busy to speak with you as well.\" He then hung up the phone.I write this review because I think yelpers are smart enough to draw their own conclusions as to whether or not this establishment warrants high ratings for overpriced Mexican food from a pretentious and insulting staff just because Rick Bayless' name is on the door. The consumer experience on the whole from sandwiches that are maybe 20% better than the average sandwich (at 3x the price) when even more offset against the wait times and slaps in the face from rude industry workers, renders the experience at Xoco one to skip, nay run, past.", "review_date": "4/6/2016"}, {"user_name ": "Cam W.", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_id": "G_WCn81CICOGoQ5_Kxtp4w", "review": "My sandwich was all bread and the food was to salty", "review_date": "2/21/2016"}, {"user_name ": "Mary L.", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_id": "9oioo7RYV8ezw6coC3y2Ow", "review": "Very popular spot but to me it just seems like mexican food for white people.

So of course when I read about Xoco I was highly enthusiastic and eager to get there immediately! We visited Saturday, their first since opening. The line was not as long as we'd anticipated...two blocks I'd read in some earlier reviews! We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes by an employee. A diner leaving told us we'd be waiting an hour, she was right! What I didn't read in the reviews before going was that the line also snakes around inside which took a further 25 minutes!I decided on the Cubana tortas until a member of staff informed those behind us it's really spicy so I settled on the Xoco salad. My partner choose the Gunthorp Chicken and Ahogada tortas. I also choose the churros as I'd never tried them, the Almendrado drink and choc/hazlenut cookie. You place your order, pay, receive a table number then seat yourself. (Any pastries are also given to you at this point) I knew it was going to be small but seriously unless you get a table by the front entrance then you have to eat off a 10 inch width of wood...yeh..not comfortable!My hot drink was brought over by a server, I regularly drink Almond milk in milkshakes so was looking forward to a sweet, smooth, creamy hot chocolate. I took three sips and left the rest. (not like me AT ALL)It was thick, clumpy, bitter, not enjoyable at all! My salad arrived. The pickled red onions...horrible. Chicken...really fatty tasting, sinewy and all dark meat. I thought 'fine I'll push the meat to the side and eat the salad leaves,' I couldn't even enjoy that. There was so much lime dressing on there, my salad leaves were sodden and tasted far too tart. The beans, I managed to find were..well they were beans! Not enough tortilla threads on there either. The only thing I enjoyed was my cookie and water. As your lining up you watch them bring the pastries out of the oven. The cookie was delicious although not enough nuts, too many choc chunks! I tried Churros for the first time...blah blah nah! Grease dripped on my silk dress, along with the copious amount of sugar. I was expecting them to be slightly more doughier not rods of crispy fried fat..which is what they were!My partner enjoyed his Ahogada, you can choose how spicy you have this. The broth was very tasty and the pork was really nice. The pork seemed to be a hit with many others whilst we were there. He didn't enjoy his Gunthorp Chicken and also commented on the fatty taste of the free range chicken. He said there wasn't nearly enough meat on the sandwich. The Sourdough bread was hollowed out which meant there was plenty of room for filling...so where was it? For those that have a sensitive roof (mouth) this bread is not a good idea.Overall we were both really, really disappointed and left there feeling sad, hungry and upset because we felt that we'd wasted $50.
