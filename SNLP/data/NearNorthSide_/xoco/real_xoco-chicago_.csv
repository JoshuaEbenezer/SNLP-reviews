"On 4/21 'Friday Night Fun' we chose to order takeout from XOCO. Best decision of the day!! We ordered a lot of food and everything was yummy at a great price!The first sign I saw when we walked in was 'Guacamole Bar' *Yea* we decided to order the Almost Naked Guacamole, made with roasted garlic tomatillos, as it was the original. By adding only homemade queso fresco , the tanginess really stood out with the fresh house made tortilla chips dusted with lime salt. The XOCO signature salad is a mixture of romaine and arugula, topped with black beans, avocado, onions, tortilla strips and a tart avocado-lime dressing. The salad was light and delicious and I'll be sure to order extra dressing because it is wonderful!The crispy Chicharrones were a delicate and airy treat topped with queso anejo, cilantro, and onions. I don't say this very often, but the side of tamazula hot sauce was almost too hot for me. So I'm glad it was on the side- the kick was powerful!The side of Oaxacan-style Peanuts came in a cute cellophane package; the seasoning of roasted garlic with lime and arbol chiles tasted just as it looked- spicy salty goodness!When it came to the Meal-In-A-Bowl Caldos, we decided on the slow-cooked pork carnitas. The broth was delightful, containing potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, arugula, and avocado. The dry ingredients were on the side so they didn't get soggy. The ratio of broth to product was perfect and I even dipped my portion of the tortas into the soup to sop up that mouth-watering broth. We ordered three styles of tortas for variety and each one had flavors that stood out on their own:The Cubana (from the griddle) had thick strips of bacon piled on smoked pork loin, topped with black beans, avocado, jack cheese, chipotle mustard, morita chiles, and a house made cilantro crema. It was smoky, creamy, and hearty. The Daily Special for Friday was the Smoky Garlic Shrimp. The seared, plump and juicy shrimp were smothered in chipotle-garlic mojo with arugula, black beans, onions, and goat cheese. Each bite was a harmonious blend and one ingredient never overpowered the others.The Woodland Mushroom (from the wood burning oven) was easily my favorite of the tortas. As the vegetarian option, it had meaty wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, black beans, arugula, goat cheese, housemade three-chile salsa, and a drizzle of olive oil. I savored Every. Single. Bite. and wished we had ordered two of them. We received extra tomatillo and three-chile salsas- much appreciated!I wanted to try the Xoco flan, but they were out, so I opted for the Tres Leches Cake as my birthday dessert. The pistachios and oranges were amazingly colorful and the bright spongy cake melted in my mouth. It was lovely to behold, had style, flavor, richness, and was easily shareable. The Mexican Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie was a good size with large chunks - delectable!Eating from Xoco was a wonderful experience for me and a great introduction to Mexican street food. I will be back to try the flan :)","4/26/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=M6o_5diZgqzdswJnWZNKzg","Nicola P."
"Came here with my coworkers for lunch once because I had heard great things about this place. The food was ""okay"" at best, but it was a little overpriced for the portion size.

"Xoco is a more affordable option for Rick Bayless lovers that don't want to shell out $100 plus for a good dinner.  The beloved torta rates in at $9-$12 for a fabulous lunch or dinner.  Order when you enter by placing your order at the counter and then a hostess will show you to a numbered table and they will bring your food out to you when ready.  (turn around was quick 5-10 minutes).  Tortas are very shareable plates so if you have more than two people order a few different ones, so you can share.  We shared the Pibil (pork) and all tortas come cut in half.  Ours had a great crunch in the bread and some great sauce on the pork.  If you like spice this one comes with a habanero sauce but be careful this sauce is hella HOT!!  They also have alcoholic drinks here (didn't try).  But I can speak for the agua frescas they were delicious!","4/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2FvLETSSBOTsyuQmAsQrxQ","Amber L."
"Not gonna lie been a big fan of Rick Bayless, used to watch him on tv all the time. Came by here for a quick lunch. I always thought this was a sit down restaurant, but after coming it it kinda of gave me a ""Mexican Panera Bread"" vibe. I got the short rib sandwich, which was the special of the day. The sandwich was pretty flavorful, reminded me of the sandwich i got at Cemitas Puebla!! Add a delicious chocolate flan, and my lunch was close to $20.. Don't know if the price point is worth the portion size, also including the ""panera"" fast food atmosphere. I think I would prefer Rick's other spot Frontera Fresco over this spot for those reasons. But one thing is clear Bayless knows how to make tasty food!","4/27/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z-ac4aPTz64j2ehH7qfqcg","AJ M."
"Xoco is high-quality Mexican cuisine served fast-food style. They feature sandwiches, sides, and desserts plus Margaritas. A remarkable place for unbelievable authentic Mexican food.If you are coming for lunch, get here early if you can. The line grows fast. You essentially order at a counter and then find a table or bar counter.  They will bring your order to you.  The service is very attentive. The staff is welcoming and regularly checking with you to ensure you have what you need.I usually order guacamole fully dressed which comes with spicy roasted poblano, chicharrón (crispy fried pork skin), grilled onion, smoky bacon, local tomatoes, queso fresco (fresh cheese), pumpkin seeds, minus the pumpkin seeds LOL. The guacamole is refreshingly fresh and creamy.I essentially come here for the tortas. I always say next time I'll get tacos, but I keep coming back to the tortas. The quality of the food is as respectable as any upscale restaurant. I've tried several of the tortas and these are ones I keep ordering again and again.AHOGADA - pork carnitas, black beans, tomato-Arbol chile broth, pickled onions. This is by far my favorite torta. The presentation alone is worth ordering, the two halves standing on end in a bowl of tomato-based goodness. The levels of flavor are heavenly.COCHINITA PIBIL - Wood-roasted Gunthorp suckling pig, achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero. You can never go wrong with suckling pig! LOL. This sandwich is another amazing Rick Bayless masterpiece.CHIPOTLE SHRIMP - Mexican blue shrimp, avocado-tomatillo salsa, local artisan Jack, pickled Manzano chiles, arugula. If you're lucky enough to be in Chicago on a Friday, you must try the daily special. This torta is bright and fresh with incredible flavor.GOAT BARBACOA - braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions, cilantro. Another daily special for Saturday, but the braised goat is so enjoyable.I highly recommend coming to Xoco, the food is unbelievably awesome. Xoco is by far the best Mexican food I've had from a place that is basically a fast-food restaurant. It's a must stop for me whenever I'm in Chicago.","3/25/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nT5usSDYKPL8wJu4zcm8jw","Thadd J."
"Ordered the chicken tinga and the spare rib tacos. For $12-$13 for four tacos, it's a pretty decent price. The tacos were juicy and tender. The avocado slice in each taco gave it a creamy texture offsetting the meatiness of the taco. The spicy sauce that came with it was very tasty (and I normally hate spicy sauces). The churro was delicious. Definitely get the chocolate shot to dip the churro. Not the softest churro but still great.","4/1/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=etNQ48VMk-5pX60cuAqs8w","Abby T."
"Xoco is the most reasonably priced, laid back and casual restaurant of Rick Bayless's Chicago outposts. The menu here is composed of mostly Mexican sandwiches, soups, and snacks as well as some breakfast options and a few cocktails. A great place to come for a unique lunch.Located in Chicago's bustling downtown River North area on the same block as two of Bayless's other more upscale dining locations (Topolobampo and Frontera Grill). You walk in and hop into line which was short when I arrived around 11:30 AM on a thursday in July but grew tremendously fast thereafter. After ordering you retreat to a table or counter stool of your choice with your drinks and your food will be brought out and delivered to you soon after. Note that if you order an oven roasted sandwich like I did it will take about 15 minutes to come out.For my food I of course had to order the churros with housemade chocolate for dipping since they get constant rave reviews and always make the list of top foods to try in Chicago. I also went with the Thursday specialty shortrib sandwich for my main course. The churros and chocolate were pretty good but nothing out of this world. The shortrib sandwich was very good and came with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The sandwich came loaded with black beans, cactus salad, and avocado which made for a delicious, flavorful, and unique blend of flavors. For a drink I ordered the Mezcal Fresco which tasted a bit watered down and was small for the cost of $11.Overall I totally recommend this place as a really nice and reasonably priced lunch spot for a unique Mexican meal prepared by people who know what they're doing when it comes to Mexican cooking. I would also recommend skipping the cocktails and getting here by 11:30 AM or be prepared for a long line.","3/6/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ozVlStttOsOZ7TqJIxGq8A","John K."
"After a recent visit to Madrid I've kept my eyes open for churro con chocolate options stateside.  Boom! Xoco was conveniently located a few blocks from my hotel in Chicago. Thank you, Yelpers. I'm a huge fan of Bayless' work - be it restaurants or his PBS show. This business is a great extension of his farm to table focus with greens grown in his backyard and meat sourced from Gunthorp Farms in northern Indiana. As you wind your way through the ordering line at Xoco you can read about where the ingredients are sourced and see the cuisine being made before your eyes (beautiful open kitchen with a window overlooking the sidewalk). The menu is fast casual with an emphasis on high quality ingredients. As for the churro, they offer a classic churro con chocolat as well dipped options like pistachio and chocolate and peanut butter. I opted for the dipped chocolate peanut butter. I so wish I could have given this experience five stars but the churro seemed to have been fried in the same oil as other dishes for the restaurant (savory dishes). In the end it tasted too oily and tortilla-ish. It seems like this would be an easy fix or maybe someone accidentally fried it in the wrong spot? :/ I will definitely return for the savory options. The environment and price are also worthy of a return visit.","3/2/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AHRrG3T1gJpHvtpZ-K0G_g","Brittany S."
"I was in Chicago for a vacation and we felt like Mexican food so after reading some reviews of a few places we settled on this restaurant and were very glad we did. Don't expect a fancy sit down type of place. You stand in line to order your food and then they bring it out to you. We both got the vegetable tacos which came with 4 small soft shell tacos and were absolutely delicious. It doesn't come with anything else but we ordered their naked guacamole which comes with two toppings of your choice. We selected poblano and grilled onions. Everything was awesome!!","4/21/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uZzLrBQDj29O28Jj3WDfOA","Billy L."

They carry a few beers, I got a margarita it was on the small side but good. It's Mexican food but at least for me I don't have tortas too many times throughout the year so when I go it's unique.

"I came here on a mission to eat delicious tortas and churros and hot chocolate, and was not disappointed. The vegetarian torta is so flavorful it'll please a meat eater; the mushrooms ain't no ordinary shrooms, you'll see what I mean. The pistachio churro was not that great, but the normal churros are excellent. We ordered ""Mexico City style"" thick hot chocolate to drink, and ate the churros with that instead of the thicker dipping chocolate. SO GOOD and chocolatey- none of that diluted nonsense. Don't leave without trying it.","3/1/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DAs6YHGzmwSCHlNVzIONeg","Ivan K."
"It's hard to stay away from Xoco when the weather is nice, even harder when the weather is chilly. They serve a quick, excellent product. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner you're going to get fed and at a reasonable cost. The salads are treated with the same care and quality as their tacos. When you enter the host is running referee/interference. They'll ask, ""dine in or out?"" and ""how many?"" You get a number for a corresponding destination table. If you want take out,  the menus are near the cash register. Calling it in will save you some time. The other thing I love is their music.  Keeps you moving. Even early in the morning, the staff and you will be shaking it.","4/13/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hjivOG6tPOLVs86mlWqgMA","Liz J."
"im a fan of rick bayless and his dedication to mexican cuisine, even took a picture with him when the team was dining at topolobampo years ago.  i frequent tortas frontera in the airport - basically pick up a cubano every time i fly out of o'hare.  a bunch of us came here for a quick bite before heading to the minds matter gala recently, and unfortunately i wasnt very impressed. first - you cant order food without first securing a table, which is facilitated by the staff with little success.  you can order drinks while you wait for a table though, which is a huge plus, because their margaritas (especially at happy hour prices) are legit AF.  wait in line, then their staff will tell you that you can order food. the process wasnt as seamless as it should be - need some process improvement notes here. i got the happy hour quac (2 toppings) and most of my friends got the fully dressed. i think the fully dressed takes away from the guac, but we all devoured every little bit, so obviously you must get this. we all settled on sandwiches - i got the top chef special with beef tongue, since this isnt available at tortas frontera and i wanted to try something new.  sadly, i wish i had stuck with the cubano! the bread to main ingredient ratio was quite off - there was a lot of bread to chew through before you get to the main event.  and i thought the flavors werent as pronounced as some of the chef's other works.overall, xoco is an excellent choice if you want a quick, authentic bite in river north without breaking the bank. i just wasnt as impressed whit most recent visit.","4/4/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=H_DAhIymP_8kpu1kw07Xtw","Christina L."
"Xoco is a go to for us when in Chicago. Rick Bayless has created a casual venue featuring a wonderful menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We came for breakfast and the Wood Oven Chilaquiles are spectacular! It's got everything spicy and cheesy in a bowl: tortilla chips, roasted tomato-serrano sauce, Samuel's cheese, poblano rajas, and scrambled eggs. I don't know Samuel but his cheese is absolutely scrumptious! A chocolate espresso was my drink of choice. It was heavenly and gave me the perfect morning bump.

"When I first came here, I thought this place was amazing. I really liked the food and the whole order, pay, and sit down situation. But after loading my picture of the Thursday special shortrib sandwich that I ordered for $12.50, Yelp made me realize that I can't give this place a 4 knowing how small that sandwich was for that price.Like damn, I still can't believe that small thing was $12.50.The shortrib sandwich was good though, it didn't taste like shortrib at all. More like a pulled pork consistency which was a shame because I would have thought shortrib would have been bigger meatier pieces but for it to come out as soft pulled pork quality, this was not worth the amount they charged.The hazelnut churro was pretty bomb but the pistacio had that lingering artificial pistacio taste which was disappointing. I'd come back during happy hour and try another sandwich because I did like this place. But just not the pricing.","2/2/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sS7UeAjv2E1pb5Z9ty0XEg","Tam N."
"I was disappointed! Not because it was bad, but because it was average in all aspects. It was basically Fontera which i could have had at my university itself. Imagine, they don't even have a separate receipt for themselves. Definitely not worth 4 stars from 3k+ reviewers.Irrespective of the average food, I also expected better service for the price I paid. We paid around 65 for 3 of us for a self service structure.I did like Sikil Pak and the margaritas though..

"Always a great place for a good torta- this time around had the carne asada daily special.  Fresh bread, tender meat and good flavor.  Had several of the tortas over the years and all are pretty solid choices, especially like the pepito and milanesa.  Also had guac to start -I'm a purist so keep it pretty simple without all the toppings available to add on...","3/13/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UvpSUxJk8Ai9XHbDgi5YqQ","Tazeen L."
"The two times I've been here the weather has been COLD... which calls for hot chocolate and churros! Mexico City Thick - this is hands down the ultimate hot chocolate! It's thick, creamy, and so delicious! A small cup really goes a long way because it's so rich and chocolate-y!The churros - the churros are fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There's a good amount of sugar and cinnamon powdered on. Although you have an option to add a chocolate dip on the side, I just dunked into my Mexican City Thick hot chocolate.","1/28/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1-5YghuD_7sLuD01f6hrJw","Mee V."
"I've been eating here for years and I love this place! It's my go-to when I'm in the area and I want food. At this point I've tried almost every torta on the menu and I can honestly say they're all amazing. But I have my favorites.My top 3 are the Baja Chicken, the Choriqueso, and the Goat Barbacoa (the Saturday special).The Baja Chicken is a delicious chicken sandwich. Unlike many of the other tortas, this one isn't as greasy. When I come here with a friend and we decide to split the tortas (they're cut in half) I always make sure one of us order this one. Sometimes you need something to offset all oil. And this sandwich satisfies that need while tasting insanely delicious.The Choriqueso is a delicious, greasy, chorizo filled sandwich. You shouldn't even smell this sandwich if you're on a diet. But all the chorizo is definitely worth it. This sandwich just melts in your mouth and you definitely appreciate the structure of the bread. The bread seems a bit of an overkill for most of their sandwiches but for the Choriqueso it is a necessity because the grease just gets absorbed. And you still have a sandwich, not a mess.The Goat Barbacoa is delicious and I'm sad it's only available on Saturdays. As such, I've only had it a few times but it's wormed it's way into my heart by satisfying my stomach. The braised goat just melts in your mouth. Other things I recommend are the guacamole and their margaritas. Just spend the 8 dollars to get all the toppings on the guacamole. And the margaritas are just delicious. Overall, I definitely recommend coming here. It's one of my favorite restaurants and I'm sure it can be yours too!","3/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cVce0x5fvbP7oBEtkfO9sw","Anamaria H."
"Xoco has been a go-to of mine and my husband's long before we moved to Chicago last year, but we had never made it out of bed early enough to do brunch! We did It! And we were not disappointed in the least. Husband had pork belly chilaquiles - the Samuel's cheese was a standout against the tender pork belly. My brother and I both went for the Saturday special (enchiladas with creamy poblano and tomatillo salsa). I had mine with chicken and he had his with chorizo. Both were divine! I even asked for some hot salsa and they went next door to Topolobampo to get me their habenero salsa (which hadn't been prepped for breakfast at Xoco). Super nice of them - the salsa had some serious heat balanced with beautiful citrus. All 3 of us dotted out dishes with it.

"After Friday nights craziness I was hunting for a michelada on Saturday morning.Found two Mexican places nearby and I picked this one.Walked in and was greeted with a menu, it's like an order and pay first and they pick a seat for you kinda place, or to go.I didn't know what to pick, everything looked amazing!I made sure they had a michelada, which they did.BUT unfortunately it was made with tomato juice instead of Clamato. Still drank it cause I felt death near lolI ended up ordering the torta ahogada which hit the spot. You can order the sauce mild-hot. I picked medium and it was the perfect spicy.I sat right next to the servers pick up window so I could see everything people ordered and oh man everything smelled and looked great. I wanted to order one of the soups but decided not to until I actually got my sandwich.Served in a pool of tomato spicy soup, the sand which is placed in the middle... vertically.

"I initially heard about this place because I'm a fan of Rick Bayless so when I heard he opened this fast casual sandwich shop WITH house made churros I had to try it. This is the type of place when you order at the counter and then patiently await your food as it gets delivered to your table. A few items I ordered that I'd recommend:Sandwiches: Braised meats with a dipping broth and super yummy crusty bread. Ahogada: Carnitas with a spicy chili broth to tip in (for those of you who would love to eat spicy food but your body just won't allow it, they can make this mild)Cochinita Pibil: roasted suckling pig (need I say more)Try to go on a Saturday for the Goat special!

I also ordered a regular churro and a side of chocolate to dip it in. The chocolate is really heavy in terms of 'chocolate'.Also ordered a chocolate drink, couldn't finish it.

"Despite the 4 stars and over 3000 reviews, my expectations were not unusually high for Xoco stepping inside for the first time. I expected some decent Mexican fare but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I was just hungry and in some desperate need for something to satisfy my hunger pains.Stepping inside, the hostess was very friendly and helpful. She gave us menus to peruse and once we found some items to our liking, she directed us to the cashier after assigning us a table number. The cashier will ask for your table number with your order. We ordered the carnitas tacos and the vegetable caldo (meal-in-a-bowl soup). They have a machine that dispenses both regular water and sparkling water, with glasses available on the side so you don't need to ask them for any. Once we were done ordering and getting our waters, the hostess showed us to our table. Not too long afterwards, our food came. We got four carnitas tacos ($12). The tacos have guacamole, onions, and cilantro. They were really good and flavorful. I gobbled my tacos and instantly wanted more. The real winner of the meal, however, was the caldo. Typically, I don't order veggie soups at restaurants since they're usually bland and devoid of ingredients. This veggie soup, however, was fantastic. It had black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, potato-masa dumplings, avocado, serrano chile, and other greens. All for $10.50. It was very filling, and it tasted so, so good. I was very surprised at how hearty and delicious this caldo was. It really is a meal in a bowl of soup. The perfect dish for a cold day in the Windy City. I would absolutely come here again. And I wish there was one where I lived. I know Rick Bayless is a prominent chef in the Chicago area, especially with the popular Frontera Grill and Topolobampo.

"Aah so good! Ordered:Smoky Bacon Mollete Aztec hot chocolateCurrently staying at the Aloft hotel after a concert and this was less than a minute away. Just wanted to grab a quick breakfast (and I heard this was a Rick Bayless spot) so I walked over. Small, but cute. Local and different beers available and showcased (I'd try one but it's 10:30am). I waited maybe 3 minutes to order and 5ish minutes for my food, so pretty quick. The mollete! Bread was soft with a crispy crust, yumm. Perfect amount of cheese too. The smoky chipotle really set it off though, it brought this warmth and, well, smoke that just made it so good. Not really much heat either. The Aztec chocolate is what I really fell in love with though. It comes out piping hot, so take a second before downing it. Smooth chocolate, with warming chile and a touch of sweet allspice. I died. After I revive from this hot chocolate, yeah, I'm probably coming back.","4/1/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=H01s0zIetqJdgmHKfT8JsA","Fatimah A."

"If I have only one day in Chicago, XOCO is definitely my top pick for lunch.  I can't remember one bad dish from this place, but not everything was perfect. The consistency can vary a bit for few dishes, but never fell below certain level.I had three different soups, and they were all flavorful with plenty of ingredients.  The vegetable soup was a bit salty but not too bad.  My favorite was the pork belly vermicelli.  This was a perfect pairing with the pork belly torta.  No such thing as too much pork belly.The churros were out of this world. I have yet find a place with better churros.  They were nearly perfect deserving of five stars.  They were so good that everything else including chocolate dipping sauce cannot elevate them higher.  I was tempted to try the glazed churros, but decided to stick with the original.","2/18/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TjlypHXquJGnRKzNEd4ysQ","Roger W."

I haven't tried the other foods here but I hear nothing but positive reviews. $12-$15 for large bowl of soup after tax isn't cheap, but the bone-warming flavor bomb is worth it.

"I've eaten at XOCO twice and it's become a go to spot for lunch downtown. The first word I think of is systematic. I walk in and there's always someone there to hand me a menu and explain the ordering process. Then they give you your spot to sit at and you just wait while the food is being prepared.My favorite item on the menu would have to be the Milanesa, which a griddled torta, or sandwich. It's loaded with crispy chicken, black beans, jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa, and homemade cilantro crema, served with a side of green salsa. Crispy, salty, sweet, heat. It's just a big messy pile of perfection. I've also had the carne asada sandwich, which is only offered on Tuesdays. It's juicy flank steak, chimichuri, local mushrooms, and homemade crema. I'm a sucker for a good chimichuri and this sandwich does not disappoint.Also, make sure to grab a churro. These aren't cheap bland churro that taste like they just came out of a microwave or a heating lamp. They're crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. And they don't skimp on the cinnamon sugar either. For $1.60, it's completely worth it.The prices aren't cheap, but they're fair considering its River North and these are items you can't get anywhere else. The one other thing that bothers me is the agua frescas aren't huge and there are no free refills. I like the original lime a lot, but if they're offering the orange pineapple fresca, don't pass it up!","3/1/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QPPRfD8JxPypOgIP2ekTTQ","Adam B."

"Rick Bayless, you devil you, well...you've done it again - you have conjured up a delicious tasting menu that makes me sit back and wonder at your culinary prowess.  As I have protested many times in the past, I am a lover of all that fantastically greasy Mexican food , but I can appreciate the modern twist that catapults good food to great food.  My curious mind wonders, though, how in the world does Rick Bayless come up with this stuff?  And, how did he become a Mexican foodie god?  I may never know the answer, but I bow down to him.  Obviously, I adored the food so you're probably asking why I gave it three stars?  I'm going to discuss the not-so-positive parts first...when walking into Xoco I found myself saying, ""what the hell is going on"" because we couldn't figure out if it was a Chipotle-type of deal or if it was a sit-down restaurant.  Initially, there was nobody to greet us, but eventually the host came out from her hiding spit and informed us that we were to look at the menu, order at the counter and have the food brought to our assigned (numbered) table.  I found this entire process to be anything but intuitive or efficient...not to mention inconvenient.  It seems that there could be a much better process for ordering food/being seated.  This entire dilemma left me confused and a little annoyed because I so desperately wanted this to be a five-star review.Because I don't want to focus in the negatives, I'm going to woosah, and shift gears to talk about the incredible food.  The sandwiches seem so simple, but they're excellent.  My fiancé and I actually split two sandwiches - the Albondingas and the Choriqueso.  Both were great and I can't choose which I liked better.  Both had a little kick to them, but it wasn't anything to astronomically spicy.  We also ordered the guacamole which was delicioso!  Then, because we have such large sweet tooths, we loaded up on the hot chocolate, churros and creamy horchata custard.  Pistachio-glazed churro - amazing.  Hot chocolate - doubly amazing (go for the Aztec!).  But the creamy horchata custard was hands-down, the best part of the meal.  The flavors in this thing were like nothing I've tasted before.  YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THIS!I absolutely loved the food, but I can't say that I'd be moved to come back here, but that's for a lot of reasons I'm sure none of you care about.  I view this place more as a restaurant that's good for lunch as opposed to dinner, but that's just my opinion.  I do however, think it's a place to hit up at least once!","10/25/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A","Lauren K."

"A fantastic little Mexican restaurant nuzzled back in a very busy part of downtown, this is quite a gem. I guess if one were to classify Xoco, you'd have to call it an upscale modern Mexican fast food restaurant. It's got just enough panache to justify the higher prices but it's casual enough that you can relax and chill for a minute. The food is exceptional! I had the short rib tacos, a horchata and a churro to finish it all off. The tacos were absolutely fantastic and just the right portion size. The churro was probably the best I've had. The horchata... Well, it was good but not in the range of the best I've tried and too expensive to justify getting again. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!","4/9/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_ireXTpAJwUchkC71J-qoQ","Stewart P."
"Rick Bayless's casual dining restaurant was decent but nothing to sing home about. // SERVICE // Order at the counter and seat yourself. Servers were pretty apathetic and not very enthusiastic about explaining menu choices. Restaurant is well maintained and easy to grab items you need. And the end of the day it is a ""fast-food"" place so I guess you cannot expect as much. // FOOD //      + Chilaquiles: tasty and the tortilla had a good crunch. Sauce was flavorful.      + Churro with chocolate: undercooked, boring, and lacked flavor in both the churro and sauce. The place is worth a try if you want to try Rick Bayless but are short on time or funds.","10/11/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U08FBOaRQCk-IAcHPAxzKA","Pauline P."
"This place was recommended by a family member. They recommended having the churros there and they were good. I recommend getting the pistachio or hazelnut flavour. The chocolate flavoured food and drinks such as churros and coffee is dark chocolate which is bitter for my liking so unless you like dark chocolate, go for it. In terms of ordering, make sure you line up to order and pay at the cashier before sitting. We had some confusion going in as we thought it was just sit down. Luckily there was somebody at the front to guide us.","10/22/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nefYrZL3vAdTd9SBPf8kPg","Steph C."
"Overall: If you're willing to spend a few extra, Xoco is a fantastic spot to get a tasty sandwich or soup with latin flair. The good: Food tasted great, with from the guac to the fresh chips to the soups and sandwiches. The guac and chips came out really quickly and the food, once ready, was hot and delicious. The line is long, but the service was really friendly. Great beer/cocktail selection.The bad: Delicious, but pricey for a lunch. $13 for a sandwich or soup?

"Stopped by for lunch, and since it was cold, I thought soup sounded delicious. I ordered the carnitas caldo. It came with a few sad pieces of carnitas, some arugula and greens, avocado, and a few tiny ""dumplings"" that would be more adequately described as balls of dough. Not quite the ""meal in a bowl"" that I was expecting-- for the name, I expected a hearty soup with lots of filling meat and dumplings. In addition to the ridiculous portion size, the soup was virtually undrinkable since it was so salty. The price was also another sore point-- the location is expensive, but this was unbelievably overpriced for the portion size and quality.Not sure I'll ever come back, but the tortas are probably the only decent thing here.","1/11/2017Updatedreview","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LnovPC4LNKzqHSzBvR1mvA","Tiffany L."
"Churros for lunch? I can work with that! :)Stopped at Xoco to grab a quick bite shortly after arriving in Chicago. Their pescetarian torta option is only available on Friday and I didn't feel like getting too full since we had a dinner resy in a few hours so churros only it is! However, my boyfriend ordered the goat barbacoa torta (their Saturday special). When I asked him what he thought of it, ""5/5. Easy,"" he said. On to the churros, we ordered each of the glazed ones: pistachio, hazelnut and chocolate-peanut. Hazelnut was my favorite. Didn't really care for the chocolate-peanut since the chocolate was pretty bitter. Also, the same reason why I didn't care about the Authentic (fresh ground chocolate and water). Although, I do think it's pretty cool that they roast and grind their chocolate in house. I'm sure I would have enjoyed their other chocolate drinks but unfortunately we didn't make a second stop here during our trip.

You order first and are told to take a seat. We had to order our lunch and dessert at the same time. Initially I thought that was smart to do. Then j realized it takes a while for the wait staff to realize you're done with your food and ready for the next course. The Ugly:The restaurant is small, festive and cozy.

"I'm a Rick Bayless fan as I have watched him on Top Chef Masters (he was also on Iron Chef America)! I was excited to check this place out as this place has been on my list of restaurants to try. Parking: there's paid street parking on nearby streets. We parked by RPM Italian which was across the street. The restaurant is located on a corner. We kinda got lost looking for the entrance and almost ended up going to an apartment complex but found the entrance when people were leaving with their to go lunches.You walk into the restaurant, and the hostess gives you a menu so you can look at what you want to order. There's also a menu on the wall. There's two lines, one for take out and one for dine in. You order the food at the counter, the person at the counter will assign you a table number, then the waiter will guide you to your table. Food: I ordered the ahogada torta ($11), which is one of the more popular items on the menu. It has pork carnitas with pickled onions and it sits in a chile broth. You can choose your spice level and I chose mild but it was a little spicy for me. I wish the bread wasn't soggy because I like my sandwiches dry. I usually don't like dipping my sandwiches in sauce (like French Dip in Au Jus or Italian Beef) but I appreciate that the sandwich was flavorful with the onions and chile broth and that the pork was tender.  My dad ordered the seafood caldo, or soup, ($13) with shrimp, catfish, mussels, cilantro, and lime in chile broth. He liked his soup but he wished he had rice with it to make it more filling. (we're Asian, we eat rice with everything!) We also had chips with tomatillo and 3 chile salsa. The chips had a hint of lime flavor and I preferred the 3 chile (green) salsa over the tomatillo (red) salsa.For drinks, I tasted the Authentic Hot Chocolate ($3), which had ground chocolate and water and my dad had the agua fresca ($3), agua del dia (water of the day), Raspberry Lime. My hot chocolate was rich but a little bitter, it tasted like dark chocolate. It took some getting used to but I ended up liking the bitter taste. My dad liked his Raspberry Lime agua fresca, though it was more on the lime-y side. As for dessert, we had the pistachio, hazelnut, and original plain churro with the chocolate dipping sauce on the side. Of all the churros, the pistachio had the best flavor and I recommend ordering that one if you had to choose a flavor. The churros tasted like donuts and were not greasy. The glazed (pistachio, hazelnut) churros are $2.25 each while the plain ones are $1.60 plus the chocolate dipping sauce on the side is $1.25.I wish the prices weren't Top Chef prices ($11 sandwich, $13 soup, total for food and drinks was $36 plus $8 for desserts) but the food was enjoyable and it was good! It wasn't amazing but I was glad to try something different! Verdict: My dad and I enjoyed our food but not sure if we are coming back due to the price of the food. It was great to try the food and I saw Rick Bayless in person at the restaurant! (fangirling!!) This experience has actually made me more curious in trying his other restaurants like Lena Brava.","1/18/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pL-_z43kBXdw0SLuFd9GWA","Tess C."
"Xoco - more like muy delicioso! We heard great things about this place and had to try it out since our hotel was right around the corner. We ordered the Pork Belly Chilaquiles and Shrimp and Egg Breakfast Sandwich - both were super flavorful and the perfect size for an early morning meal! Unfortunately, we went so early that they were only serving breakfast and we wanted to try some of the lunch offerings. This isn't a typical sit-down restaurant, but the quality of food is still on point. When you walk in they give you a table number and you order and pay ahead - which makes things easier if you're looking for a quick bite! We were in and out in about 30 minutes. Overall, Xoco has some pretty authentic flavors and we would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for great Mexican food in River North!","1/13/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G0vHlUSxnPT8Xp5AApsoDA","Kelci L."
"I thought this place was solid. We had the Pozole soup, which was great, the loaded guac, which was awesome, and one of the tortas. The torta was good but as with everything that is upscale it was on the smaller side. It tasted way better with some spiciness added to it. For dessert, we split a churro and had a few sips of the Aztec drinking chocolate, which was wonderfully divine. Hot chocolate has always been a real treat for me, which basically means I never have it, so a few sips was all was needed. I recommend this place for a nice late lunch on the weekend when the line is probably not as long. I particularly love the vibe of this place - lots of lively Mexican music that makes this place really fun to spend an afternoon.","1/14/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lxaBfy6snoCHWtN5KPrZtw","Monica Q."
"Been here twice and first time was during the winter time when I was craving for some hot choco and churros. Thanks to Yelp, I found this place.Ive seen some people get confused but when you walk in, someone will be waiting to greet you and ask if you are dining in. Then, they assign you a table number; you get in line, give your assigned table # to the person at the register and when youre done, somebody directs you to your assigned table, then they bring the food out :) We ordered the 3 for $4 churros plus one authentic hot choco, and one aztec (spicy hot choco). They were both really good but were so chocolatey and rich so we thought for next time, we'll just share one drink. We came here again recently after having a nice meal across the street. This time I tried the pistachio covered churro. It was very delicious and satisfying!

There are two queues one for online orders and to go pick up and another for seating and ordering. The lady at the to go counter seemed flustered and unhappy by my arrival (more work). Behind her there was the oven where tortas were being toasted. Food was being sent out and it looked amazing!! The food was indeed amazing!!!!! All our tortas were great! Crispy bread, great salsa. We also got churros which came with chocolate. To die for! Ok don't die because you will want to eat it again. But worth it all! Must go. I remember eating it at O'hare and loving it.

"This is a great lunch spot that my fiancé and I were happy to find. Just a quick walk from our hotel, Palomar, we made a point to go on a weekday before the real lunch crowd set in. Easy enough to order and sit down, we chose tortas (Baja chicken and choriqueso) and chips and salsa. We didn't realize how much food it would all be, but truly it was all delicious! Salty chips and fresh salsas accompanied by really well put together ingredients on the sandwiches made for a memorable meal. I preferred the Baja chicken to the choriqueso, but my fiancé loved both. I feel like there was a licorice taste to the choriqueso that I couldn't quite get past. I wish I was in the area more frequently so I could discover other menu items!

You can taste the smokiness of the different meats, kick from the cheese, and freshness from the avocado slices!! If the two times I've been here, I've ordered churros both times.

"I came here a few months back and overall, wasn't too impressed with the food and atmosphere here. I got the choriqueso, and while I liked the flavor profile of the sandwich, I felt like it was a little pricey for what I got, and didn't taste like anything out of the ordinary. One thing that bothered me about this place was how crowded it seemed. I might have just been here at a busy time, but when we were seated, we ended up sharing a table with two other strangers. Maybe I came here with expectations that were a little-too-high (the friend that I came with hyped it up a lot), and maybe I just need to try something else on the menu, but overall I'd pass this spot up for many of the other restaurants around this area.","12/25/2016","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2LcC1R65TLmgfj1djSnguw","Jerry H."
"Xoco provides delicious Mexican sandwiches and hearty soups at a slightly high price in a prime River North Location.The restaurant is an order at the counter type with an open kitchen. The lines are a bit long and can move quite slowly. The location is also relatively small, so seating can be limited at peak hours.The food itself is pretty solid, although pricey. Sandwiches and hearty soups will run you from 10-20 dollars. I've come here multiple times and tried the specials, but my favorite is the Cubana. The loaded guac is pretty good, although if you get it fully loaded, the guac flavor can be overpowered.Give Xoco a try!","11/29/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rq9-MQ4REq9UzwsCgbMATw","Eddie C."

"The churros are a 5 star dessert ... I will come back just for that!  Our lunch was a great 4 star.  Possibly a 5 star.  Don't get the Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk)... it was undrinkable and sour.This is the 4th Rick Bayless establishment I've been to and I would say this is my favourite so far.  Better than Lena Brava!  I love it for the service (those hostess have memories like an elephant and they manage the place so well) and the flavours.  Flavours are great here.  This is an interesting concept as it is a true fast casual restaurant.  They do offer table service but you do line up to place your order.  We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was completely packed.  They do pace the ordering so your table is available right after you order.  I do appreciate how it's not a free for all where people are jostling each other to get a table.For $40 lunch, we got the Friday Chipotle Shrimp Torta, seasonal Sweet potato caldos, their new hot chocolate with almond milk, and 3 fresh churros with the chocolate on the side.  Seeing how cold it was, I was going to get a soup for sure.  It took about 15 minutes for our meal to arrive after ordering which is pretty good seeing how crazy busy they were.  I appreciated how the staff here is constantly cleaning and making sure everything is being delivered super fast.  The Chipotle Shrimp Torta was incredibly well done... the shrimp had a nice heat and not overcooked.  I had to fight for a bite to try it.  My vegetable soup was good... I loved the heat and flavour of the vegetable broth.  The one comment I had about mine was that it was 80% shredded cabbage with only 3 potato dumpling and 2 pieces of sweet potato.  I was thinking I would have more variety than one vegetable. The broth was very good though so I was able to kinda overlook the lack of good vegetables.  The unfortunate part of the meal was the  Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk) .. it was actually quite sour.  We left the drink more than half full.  The best part of our meal (and possibly best I've ever had) was the churros.  We got 3 churros with the chocolate on the.  WOW.  Hot crispy exterior that had a great crunch when you bite into it with an airy and light interior.  The best doughnut ... even the dough had a nice flavour.  The sugar coating wasnt too much to be too sweet.  The chocolate shot was incredible ... deep dark chocolate flavour without it being too sugary and perfectly complimented the churros.  This is also we had an issue with the hot chocolate as it is supposed to be the same chocolate shot ... we practically licked the last bit of the chocolate.Overall, I'm definitely coming back for the churros but I'm also willing to try other items on the list.  Service is fast and smart and though it is packed, they move tables quickly.  Great flavours and my favourite Rick Bayless restaurant so far!","11/25/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA","Soleil S."
"Big fan! Wish they had Xoco back home, I'd be a regular for lunch or dinner. It's an interesting fast casual meets waiter service hybrid. As soon as you enter, they assign you a table, so after you've ordered your food at the counter, there's a table waiting for you. Love this little touch, as I often suffer from table-snagging anxiety. LOVED the Oaxacan menu, just different enough from run-of-the-mill Mexican, but still familiar and comforting with all those spicy flavors. I had the pozole soup, a meal-sized bowl, pleasantly too big to finish. For dessert, the Oaxacan chocolate soft serve with cajeta sauce and chocolate crumbles. Cool that they serve beer, wine, and cocktails on tap - keeping with the ""fast"" casual theme. Once seated, it feels very much like a regular nice sit-down restaurant, though nobody bothers except to bus your plates or refill your water.

"OMG Yes! I am going to be very candid and let you know that I have no idea how big a deal Rick Bayless is. Maybe that takes away my ""foodie"" accreditation. Anyway, I was there for the food and boy, did it deliver. We decided to head here for a lunch and we weren't there for the rush, we went around 1pm, so that helped a ton. We ate there and scored a spot outside. The word margarita was thrown out there and I accepted it like a champ. I mean you are about to throw down with some delicious Mexican food and you see blood orange margarita:  Pueblo Viejo blanco tequila, Beck Farm organic blood orange juice, Mexican vanilla and lime... how could you turn that down? Even at lunch. We got chips and guac for the table, went for almost naked guag which is  roasted garlic tomatillo guacamole with choice of two toppings. We got local MightyVine tomato and queso fresco. So creamy, flavorful and fresh. I went for a Caldo: Meal-in-a-bowl soup. Carnitas slow-cooked Gunthorp pork, potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, greens, arugula and avocado. It was delectable. It truly was a meal in a bowl. I topped it off with leftover chips and it added the perfect crunch. Go here.","5/12/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OgYi5x02MBukfxPNFe1ePg","Colleen B."
"A really great option if you're looking for a casual lunch, food to go or are after some Rick Bayless awesomo food but can't be bothered with the formalities of Frontera.

Sandwiches were the order of the day and these specialities come with all sort of crazy sauces or in my case soup - floating away like Free Willy coming out of the water (NB - it was pork...not whale meat...).

"Meh. Overpriced and overrated .. came in for lunch on Friday. Fast casual atmosphere, smaller, limited seating... walk up and order and take a number type of vibe. I Was pretty excited about trying their Pozole and hot chocolate ... a tad disappointed. I guess I'm bias, my mother makes the BEST pozole so I'm constantly comparing. The broth was tasty but a bit on the blander side, I ordered it ""hot"" and it seems like they just added chile powered to make it ""hot"" and I'm used to smaller onion pieces, not large chunks. I feel like the price point was a bit off too.. $13 for a soup? Come on. After tasting my coworkers hot chocolate, I decided to pass. Probably won't be retuning.","12/12/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NhTWPDnDy0UomxeFpqcNBg","Rebeca M."
"Came in for a very quick bite on a Saturday night. We didn't get a lot of items but the two that we had were delicious. The pork belly vermicelli soup (caldos) was amazing. It's got the right amount of heat, and it was very hearty, perfect for a cold night. The chips and guac were also great. We got them with spicy roasted poblano and crispy bacon toppings. Delicious, but small serving of the guac.We will definitely be back for the more iconic tortas. P.S. We got seated right after we finished ordering. The process is definitely weird, but hey, it works (for that one time, at least).","12/11/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gKyz5wNT5QE90v5UIjTlZw","Wei H."
"Found this spot on Yelp while staying in Chicago near the Mag mile. I didn't realize it was not a traditional ""sit down"" restaurant. We ordered our food up front and we're seated communally with a quiet couple, which didn't bother us much. A friend and I shared the fully dressed guacamole and the choriqueso sandwich. Both were delicious. I also indulged with two Xoco margaritas. My only complaint is that they were very small for $10. Delicious, but small. The second one I ordered, I asked if I could do no ice, and she refused. Oh well. The food was delicious and the service was attentive, even though we didn't have a waiter designated waiter.

The whole give your table number system is really confusing and inconvenient especially when you want to order extra stuffI still want to check out their many other interesting menu item, like the bacon carmeal corn, torta and vermicelli but I'm actually pretty disappointed at their food.

"Since I'm a big fan of frontera in the Chicago airport, I have been wanting to try xoco for years and unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. We came on a weekday evening and had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table for a party of 5 even though we kind of beat the rush. You wait in line and are given a table number. You then place your order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. They will hold dessert until you've finished up your entree. We had the ahogada and pork belly noodle soup. The ahogada is a pork sandwich that is placed in a bowl of thick tomato based soup. Presentation is beautiful but the mixture of flavors were a little weird for me. It could also be that I don't like soggy sandwiches and would have preferred to have the sandwich and sauce/soup separate. The pork belly soup has pork belly, mushroom, avocado, zucchini, and some bitter greens. The salsa negra is a spicy hoisin sauce. For people familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a Spanish American version of ""bun bo hue"" or spicy beef noodle soup. The dish is ok but I think it could use more noodles and less of the greens because of the bitter taste. The thing that really killed this dish for me was that I found a dead BUG in the soup. However, the manager of the store dealt with it very professionally. They offered to replace my meal and also excluded it from our bill. For dessert, we had the churros with ice cream and hot chocolate. They are known for their bean to cup chocolate. The hot chocolate is rich and somewhat bitter. I don't usually drink hot chocolate so I can't really compare it to anything. I am a huge fan of dark chocolate but didn't like the bitter or unsweet taste of the hot chocolate. The churros were warm, crispy, and good. The ice cream must be made with the same chocolate because it was also slightly bitter. I love churros and ice cream but the two didn't really go very well together. I mistakenly thought it would since the ice cream was listed as an add on to the churro. Ambiance of the restaurant is trendy, loud, and kind of tight. It is not family unfriendly but probably not the best spot for young kids. The bold flavors of the food was a bit too much for me so I would not recommend xoco for food. Come by for the churros and hot chocolate!","4/12/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lB4ju34kx4M3TO-8ierv_g","Karen T."
"I was excited to take my friends here for their first time, but I must say I wasn't too impressed this time around.  Perhaps, we ordered the wrong dishes, but I expected everything to taste good.  Lunch time on a weekday was a little chaotic.  They wouldn't take our order unless they had a seat available for us so we had to wait about 10 minutes.  This time, we ordered the Pepito Mexican torta (sandwich), the Seafood Caldo (soup), and the churros with chocolate for dipping.  My friends also ordered the Almost Naked Guacamole which came with chips and salsa.I like that they have self serve tap water and sparkling water, but I wish they get a better ice machine as it was taking forever to get the ice.Guacamole was good, but nothing special.  The torta was good especially when dipping it in the salsa, but I would have enjoyed the chicken one which I had before instead.  The seafood soup wasn't too exciting.  I think the Short Rib Red Chile one that we got last time would have been better too.  The churros were still good although it came out before we finished our food so it ended up getting cold.  Overall, this time around, it was okay.  Hopefully, the excited hype is not affecting them.","5/12/2016Updatedreview","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RdGgH2C655oklnPT3oZJ0A","Erica S."

"We visited on a previous trip to Chicago and the food was wonderful. Our latest trip had us popping in exclusively for their hot chocolate.I am not normally a fan of hot chocolate. Sticky, chocolate flavored sugar water has turned me off the drink. But when you realize the chocolate is ground on site and made in the traditional way with water it is intriguing. I tried it and fell in love so that on this trip I made it a point to come twice.It was just as delicious as I remembered it being and the next time we come, I will be back again.","4/25/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RHD1GxgRTsJRTluoNRkQ6w","Heather T."
"Every positive thing I said about this place three years ago remains true, although as more and more delicious Rick Bayless places saturate Chicago, you probably don't need me to tell you that any more. Xoco feels less like a discovery and more like a delicious-thing-you-can't-believe-you-take-for-granted.But here's a new discovery: on Wednesday nights, after 5 pm, for some reason they serve tacos al pastor. And because it is Xoco, they are delicious. I don't normally love pineapple on my tacos, but somehow it works. And the pork has a nicely chewy char that gives it both depth and texture. Highly recommended, even if Xoco is otherwise old news to you.","11/17/2016Updatedreview","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hqojrGeufv6qYpN00R-OsA","William B."

"Xoco is amazing! I've visited twice during lunch. Don't be alarmed by the line, unless its around the block or something. Both times, we have tried to arrive a little closer to 11:30 and have had no problem getting a table. the first time I went was with a party of 8! While I wouldn't recommend it for a large party in general, their system for seating seems to work really well. The food - I've had the guacamole, torta ahogada, and today for the first time, a churro! OMG the torta is delicious - pulled pork on a crusty french bread bun, with a DELICIOUS sauce, that you can adjust to your desired spicyness (I like medium & I love a little spice to all my foods). This is the torta that they will recommend to newcomers. The guac was good from what I remember, and the churro was delicious as well. Only a handful of vegetarian options if you are wondering - I think only one soup and one sandwich option, unless you want to make a meal of guac and churros, which is 100% acceptable in my world. Its definitely a great place for lunch and pretty quick (especially if you can make it an early/late/to-go lunch). I work off of W Wacker, so its a quick walk and I will definitely be visiting again!","4/14/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ad-KN1XpgrJr6j_lAfQnrg","Alyssa J."
"Very interesting concept. My friend and I got the pistachio churro and it was AMAZING! I'm quite the sweet tooth and this was divine! I only wish that they would offer more instead of just one per order. We also got the Pork Belly Noodles. We ordered one and they were kind enough to split it for us into 2 bowls. It actually tasted really good. The pork belly was really good with a crispy skin layer. Ordering is on a self-service basis but they bring the food to you and the also have wifi which is always a plus point. I'd definitely recommend trying Xoco out. If not for the main courses, then definitely the churros.

"DISCLAIMER: THEY ONLY DO TACO WEDNESDAYS DURING THE WINTER. We came for the tacos but decided to stay anyway and order other food.Before we get to the food - the place itself seems fun. There are some tables outside but the inside looks festive as well. For vibe alone, I'd come back. And everybody who worked there was really nice - I walked in prepared to be annoyed at the service - it was crowded and after work so a prime happy hour/happy taco time. But despite how crowded it was the staff was well prepared and we were seated, margaritas in hand, shortly after arriving.Now, I ordered the Pepito which is a short rib torta with this green dipping sauce. It was definitely well made and interesting. Not a taco, but still good. The bread was nice and crispy and the seasoning was done well.My friend got the Ahogada - which looked like a sandwich dipped in tomato soup which she wasn't expecting. I think I liked my sandwich better than she liked hers but she didn't dislike hers. I think we were both just out of our element and not sure what to feel or believe. Basically we were having an existential taco crisis.Margs were solid, though. Yay for tequila, bringing people together.Recommend?

"I have gotten the baja chicken a few times now and it is a fantastic sandwich, HOWEVER, on all but one of these occasions it came with a very small amount of chicken on it. I never felt the urge to complain until now as i just received my order through caviar and it came with literally two, absolutely tiny pieces of chicken on the sandwich (and not much filling overall). I'm talking these pieces are smaller than a bite, as in you would look at the sandwich and think it's some cruel joke someone is playing on you.

The service was a little awkward and we were seated right by the register (which i didn't like), but it was also crowded on a Friday afternoon/evening so they didn't have many other options. To get us started we both ordered margaritas. They were a little pricey for what they gave us because it was in small glasses, but tasted good nevertheless. I ordered the Baja Chicken Torta and I loved it! The reason for 4 stars because my friend didn't like what he had ordered and ended up throwing most of his sandwich away :/.

"We came to Xoco for dinner. The restaurant is small and so was the seating area. We ordered the ahogada, carnitas soup, and pistachio glazed churro. The ahogada was very good, but the sauce that it comes in was a little salty. The bread on the torta was excellent! So crispy on the outside and when dipped in the sauce, so good (but dip lightly). The carnitas soup came with a generous amount of carnitas. I loved the potatoes and brussels sprouts that were in the soup. The soup was a little on the saltier side as well. I think a piece of bread, some avocado chunks, and some cilantro would've been a perfect accompaniment to the soup to offset the saltiness. Definitely have to get a churro. The pistachio glazed churro was not too sweet and the churro was so crispy and soft in the inside. It comes with a generous amount of crushed pistachios and glaze. Verdict: I would come back to try the other tortas that are available, but it's not a ""omg I have to come here"" kinda place for me. The saltiness of both entrees were kind of a downer, but the delicious churro made up for it. I'm a sucker for sweets.","2/10/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ED6VtjBAKnHBDxBw2yZ8sQ","Grace L."
"Xoco is located downtown near some very good night life. Upon seeing the building you can witness the baking area and kitchen from the window which is very cool. They also have an eating area outside incase they are packed indoors. My wife and I stopped by Friday night about an hour before closing. We were concerned about the quality of food due to us showing up at this time. Once we entered we really didn't know how everything worked. So I spoke to someone who was helping another customer, and they got me in touch with the hostess. While in line to order she gave us a table number and we placed our order with a really nice young lady. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had a great personality. Our food choices are below. Chips & Salsa + Guac: The chips were freaking delicious. The texture and crunch was nice. With the chips we received a green and red salsa. Both were slightly different in flavor and not spicy at all. I'm sure they have spicier salsa but we didn't really check. Now the Guac, oh man. Not only is there fresh made Guac, they had a variety of things that enhanced the flavor. You had queso fresco, onions, tomatoes, and much more. You could also get I believe bacon as well but we do not eat pork. Pepido Torta: This is a Hispanic sandwich and there are usually several versions. This one was made of short rib meat and basically looked like barbacoa. The bread of the sandwich was a little too crunchy for my liking. The beef was delicious and the toppings were minimal and complimented each other very very well. Churros w/chocolate sauce: Let's put it this way, I ordered this for myself and had to split half with my wife. These churros were warm and the chocolate sauce tasted amazing. I was basically dipping the churro and trying to get as much sauce on it to eat. The crunch and softness was very well balanced. Cuatro Leches Cake: Traditionally we see this cake wet and with a layer of sauce at the base. This was different and delicious.

"Since I first got to Chicago, a little more than a month ago, I wanted to try Xoco.  This weekend the husband and I finally head there for lunch after a spinning class. The food is fantastic!  Nothing like south american flavors. We started with Sikil Pak, that is a pumpkin seed dip served with tortilla chips and cucumber.  It was my first time having that, very tasty and healthy.  We had the woodland Mushroom sandwich and it was so delicious!! Pretty well stuffed with lots of mushroom, goat cheese and arugula.  For a sweet taste we had three churros with a chocolate shot for dipping and we also had an Almendrado (a cup of chocolate shot with almond milk).  The churros were so very good, I must say my recommendation is to order a coffee to have with the churros, the Almendrado was way too much chocolate to have with the churros and the chocolate dip.The place itself is nice but small.  Definitely not good for big groups. Mostly comfy counter sits, I didn't mind sitting at a counter, but I do prefer sitting at a table.  The staff is great, very friendly and helpful.  There was a wait, but only 5 minutes or so.  You first place your whole order, including desert with the cashier, than you are given a table number and the hostess with lead you to your number.  The prices are affordable in my opinion.  For the snack, sandwich, churros and drinks we paid $40.  That is very reasonable to me.I plan to be back for breakfast!

"We stopped by here on a Tuesday morning for brunch while vacationing in Chicago. We had grown accustomed to long wait times at all the restaurants on our list so it was a pleasant surprise to walk into a restaurant with plenty of seating and no wait.A window on the exterior shows the chef's working their magic with chocolate to lure you in from the sidewalk. Xoco is short for chocolate, in case you didn't make that connection (like me)I was sold on the Chorizo Empanada from looking at the menu online, but torn between the chocolate Cappuccino and the Authentic. When I asked the cashier what she recommended, she said the Cappuccino but gave me a small sample of the Authentic to try too!You order at the front, are given a number, and then sit at the table associated with your number. So although there were plenty of seats available, we were assigned to sit on bar stools next to the front door. The hostess that helped us find our seat was very friendly, felt like she was welcoming us into her home (if her home was a Chipotle?). The busboy checked in frequently to take any dishes we had finished.I didn't so much like my Empanada, it had too many spices (not like spicy, but too heavy on the cumin/chili powder). I tried to make do by dousing it with salsa. My boyfriend had ordered the steak and egg torta and was willing to share so I traded him halfway through. We both liked the drinks but felt like they were a little too sweet-- particularly the chocolate that sank to the bottom on both. Oh, and we got a chocolate churro to share too. It was presented beautifully with chocolate sauce and crushed peanuts. A great dessert to finish off our breakfast! I think food wise it was about a 3.5 but the excellent service bumped it up to a 4.","7/6/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-i6OpWrJrJ2pkDFqHYnQ6g","Samiah K."

"Well, I have finally completed the ""trifecta"" of Rick Bayless' downtown Chicago restaurants, and boy was I unimpressed.  The only thing keeping it from getting a ""1 Star"" review from me were the Chips and Salsa appetizer and the Hot Chocolate.  The chips were ""ok"" and didn't taste that fresh despite the menu stating that they are ""just-made"" - I think mine were ""just-made"" hours earlier, they were cold and bland, but the salsas with them were both amazing.  The Hot Chocolate Classic I had, created an experience where the clouds parted, angels began to sing and a rainbow came down to the cup.  It was THAT. DAMN. GOOD.  Rick, thick and OhMyGodItIsSooooChocolately!  I am drooling thinking about it right now a few days later.That however is where the greatness stops.  Service was poor - I asked the person bringing out my order to the table for a glass of water, she said she would bring me one...she never did.  Ten minutes later, I stop another server and ask for a glass of water, she never brought me one.  And finally another ten minutes after that I asked a third employee for a water, and he didn't return either.And the final (and largest) disappointment was the ""torta"".  To paraphrase a quote from Lloyd Bentsen, ""Rick, I have served tortas. I know tortas. Tortas are friends of my stomach. Rick, these are not tortas.""  Tortasare supposed to be made with bread that has a soft, almost pillowy interior, the torta I had (Cochinita Piblil) was served on what I could best describe as an over-baked baguette where the insides were hard and crunchy, to the extent that it nearly made my gums bleed.  I ended up eating the sandwich filling using the aforementioned chips.I might swing back for dessert and hot chocolate, but not for the entrees, unfortunately.","12/22/2015","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4rGP_TDwRw3i4oPJJHFfKQ","George H."
"Was around the area for a buddy of mine's wedding which was in the Hyatt across the street. We had some down time so I just came in for the churros. Churros were amazing. Freshly made and the topping choices were nuts (pun intended). Pistachio churro was definitely my favorite. Had a different sweet to it. And their chocolate sauce (bitter) was really fine quality. I was licking my plate when I was done.","10/22/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9kji-9Pz_lv2eA8jxFcG2Q","Ridwan A."
"Señor Rick Bayless' Xoco is a sweet sensation. The CHURROS (3/$4) are made fresh to order and come with a crunchy bite that explodes with sheer delight. Sure it's just dough deep fried in loads of grease but the simplicity of it makes it remarkable. The chocolate dipping sauce is decadent with a nice consistency, not thick or thin, and not sweet, it's perfect. The extra $1.25 to get this is worth it. You must surrender and throw caution out the window to make it a full experience. That said, we also tried the PISTACHIO GLAZED CHURROS for $2.25 each. What a genius creation that was devoured so quickly. As long as you're not allergic to this tree nut, don't think twice, order it! All that must be paired with something hot. By that I mean hot chocolate. I sampled all types they carry from authentic, classic, aztec, almendrado, and Mexico City thick, all delicious in its own way. But I had to pick just one - the CLASSIC HOT CHOCOLATE ($3.25) won my palate. It's a shot of chocolate with 2% milk. Never gets old. You know it's a winner when nostalgia hits and brings you back to your childhood days.","12/10/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw","Marissa S."

"What do you come here for?  The churros only.  First of all when you come in the store you wait a while in line before ordering or finding a table.  You can order a drink while you wait.  Once you're almost up to the register you are given a table number, after getting a table number now you may order.  I tried the Pozole, sandwich, hot chocolate, glazed churro, and original churro. The Pozole was a bit watered down and not much ingredients to it.  The sandwich was really tasty with a soft bread to pair with it.  The original hot chocolate was overwhelming too thick and too much chocolate, I could not handle it.  The glazed churro wasn't bad.  I got the pistachio one and it was sweet because of the glaze and the churro had a perfect texture to it.  My favorite was the original churro with chocolate.  You must the churro itself.  The chocolate used ask dip was much thinner than the hot chocolate and not as chocolately either.  Overall I'd come here solely for the churros.  The prices are a bit much as a cafe style.","12/22/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TwjiWvK0ZP15lzGC049oIQ","Darylynn D."

"Xoco might just go down as the best meal I had while visiting Chicago. Loved everything about it!! You go, get in line, and they ask how many people in your party. They assign you a number and tell you where your table is. Then you order and make your way to the table, and they bring you out all your food. We were handed menus and honestly, there was like 5 things I could have ordered and loved. I've never seen a Mexican place with so many torta options! Such a great spin on a cuisine that is usually tacos and enchiladas, beans and rice (which I love, but Xoco was a fun and unique spin!). We ordered: - naked guacamole with queso fresco ($7) and comes with plenty of chips and salsa. I'm more of a purist so I like my guac a little more simple than their loaded version, but the naked guac was so good! Big chunks of avocado, great flavor. The chips!! Crispy and a little chewy, sometimes. Freshly made, warm, amazing. I loved the green salsa, too! - Cubana. Torta with roasted pork loin, bacon, black bean spread, chipotle mustard, jack cheese, avocado. This sandwich was to die for! Each bite was packed full of flavor - the smokiness was perfection paired with the creamy avocado and spicy chipotle. Yum. Yum. Yum. - Ahogada. Torta with carnitas, pickled onions, black beans, & chile sauce, served in a bowl of tomato both (literally drowned! Ahogar means to drown; I was clueless but my fluent in Spanish husband filled me in :). My husband loved this sandwich. - Churros con chocolate ice cream. Three churros that were warm and perfectly cooked sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar to give them a nice crunchy crust.

The plain churro paired so well with the vanilla ice cream. The hazelnut made a unique companion to the churro and tasted delicious. It was a hazelnut drizzle on the churro with crushed peanuts on top. I was not a fan of the chocolate churro because it was way TOO chocolatey and sweet to enjoy.

"The churros were pretty good but it was the chocolate soft serve and dipping sauce that made it for us.WAIT: A bit of a wait because it was crowded around 8:00 pm, we order first and then the woman helps you find a table.  We ended up sitting outside for a group of 7 of us and it was slightly awkward because you can't bring the stools into the sidewalk so we had to sit in one long row.ATMOSPHERE: I didn't get to see the inside very well but it looks pretty casual.  The outside was OK, you sit under an awning on the side walk but it doesn't really feel like you are part of the restaurant.FOOD: We got the 3 churro deal and added the chocolate soft serve and the chocolate dipping sauce.  All of it came out to around $8.  My friend also got the pistachio glazed churro.CHURRO - the churro itself is pretty crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Definitely pretty good.SOFT SERVE - they call themselves ""bean to cup"" because they pride themselves in their chocolate beans and you can tell it's good quality.  The soft serve had a dark chocolate flavor to it and was SO amazing.  Definitely good to eat by itself or with the churro.CHOCOLATE SAUCE - same with the soft serve the chocolate sauce had a nice rich dark chocolate flavor and was potent but perfect when dipping.  Overall, worth coming for the soft serve and chocolate dipping sauce!","4/20/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PB3OEIzQGx_p6VdpzX3Feg","Brittany T."

"I don't really understand the hype about this place. I realize that the desire is to try to take Mexican food and do something new and original with it. The problem here is that everything ""original"" is not an improvement on the original version. When you eschew  the traditional bread from a Mexican torta and replace it with a baguette-even a tasty one-it turns into something other than a torta. And when you make churros really skinny they get tough. And when you cover them with sauce they get tough and soggy.That said, most of the flavors I had were very good ones. And the habanero salsa that came with the sandwich had a wonderful flavor, although it was really too hot to eat, as I was warned.So if you want something different, you might try it, but if you want a tasty Mexican lunch, look for the little food counter at the back of most Mexican grocery stores. You'll get better stuff there.","10/23/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA","Steve A."
"Service: 4Food: 3Value: 3Meh. It was Cinco de Mayo and we wanted some Mexican food and margaritas. My husband and I were thinking of going to our usual taco place on Ashland and Chicago, but were pretty sure they didn't' serve margaritas. We were walking home from work and stopped by Mercadito but they didn't have any tables until almost 9 pm. Then we walked and saw Xoco and figured we'd give that a shot. We each got 2 margaritas, naked guac, coctel rojo (seafood cocktail), seafood caldo (soup), and the seasonal pork loin sandwich. The bill after tip was 84. Guac- Fine. Not any better than whole foods/chipotle guac Chips- fineCoctel rojo- The sauce was very tasty. It was almost sweet/tangy but spicy at the same time. The shrimp/scallops were fresh. This came with a ton of chips. Between the chips that came with this and the chips that came with our guac, we had more than enough chips.Salsas- Good. I know these salsa are popular but I like pico de gallo and chunkier salsas with chipsSeafood Caldo- lacking in flavor. The seafood was very fresh, but the broth needed something. It was such a bright red broth that I was thinking it would be packed with heat/flavor, but there wasn't much.Pork Loin sandwich- this was very tasty. We enjoyed this. The meat was well marinated and the cheese complemented it well.Margaritas- okay. for 10 dollars, I was underwhelmed. They were small, barely cold, not much salt on the rim. We should have gone to our normal hole in the wall and just had drinks at home. However, we were in the mood to go out and enjoy the nice weather. We had fun and the food wasn't bad. However, for 80 bucks, I feel like it should have been better.

"I'm a huge Rick Bayless fan and I was so excited to go to one of his restaurants while visiting Chicago. This place is pretty casual. You order at the counter and your order is delivered to your table. Although the line was a little long when we arrived, it went pretty quick. My husband and I split an order of guac. We went with the ""almost naked"": roasted garlic-tomatillo guacamole with choice of two toppings (our choice was queso fresco & poblano), tomatillo salsa, three-chile salsa, just-made chips. I'm a guacamole-aholic and this was excellent guac!! We also split one of the tortas. We ordered the Cochinita Pibil torta: wood-roasted Gunthorp suckling pig, achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero. That habanero salsa that comes on the side is fire! I mean it will leave you feeling like you are on fire. Soooo spicy! I was very conservative with it but my husband went all in and he was sweating from the heat! Luckily we had delicious xoco margaritas to cool us off. The margaritas were also excellent. They are made with Milagro blanco tequila, Combier, fresh lime & cucumber, homemade lime bitters. So refreshing!

"I wasn't overly impressed the first time I went here three years ago, but maybe I got the wrong thing that time because the past two times I've gotten the torta ahogada, which is absolutely fantastic. It's a dine-in only option, a pork sandwich submerged in a spicy tomato-based sauce (almost a soup-like consistency).

"Wish I had something original to say about Xoco but all I can tell you is that, like so many others, I recently had a delicious lunch there. My wife and I split an order of the sikil pak (kind of an Aztec-y hummus made with pumpkin seeds and tomatoes) that came with cucumber and jicama sticks and chips which was soooooooo good. Really a perfect starter and maybe healthy? I'm treating it as healthy since I mostly stuck to vegetables/licking the bowl. Sandwiches (tortas) came out next and we were impressed all over again. I had the ahogada which came drowned in a bowl of spicy soup (there were three spice-level options but to be honest the ""spicy"" wasn't that spicy. I can't imagine what the others must be like) and my wife had the sandwich of the day which was carne asada. Both were good but mine was Great (sorry, babe). The torta ahogada is the kind of sandwich that makes you get philosophical about sandwiches can be. The particular sandwich ended up being a pretty great soup in the end too, as I was losing a few bits of the pork into the dipping bowl every time the bread lost it's structural integrity. We finished off the meal with a stunning hot chocolate that I'm calling the best I've ever had even though my wife says it's not a fair competition. My biggest regret is that my wife didn't order dessert for herself that I could try because the churros look incredible.

"I've been to Xoco before years ago but only for coffee and the churros.  This trip to Chicago I wanted to actually sit down and eat there this time and have more than just dessert.My wife and I walked over to Xoco on a Friday knowing if we didn't get there on Friday or Saturday that they'd be closed Sunday and Monday.  This place is small, very small for the amount of people that want to eat there.  There is a line up leading up to the check out and while you're in line you're asked where you want to eat (inside, outside, take out).  Basically the person asking where you want to eat knows what seating is available and will marshal you to that area as it's not a self seating type of place.  You can also order a drink while in line so you can have a drink while you wait which you must pay for up front.  The seating marshal will then tell you what your table number is and you'll be assigned that seating so you don't have to scramble for a place to sit down.  This place is pretty noisy inside.  The only seating available was outside which has both stools and low chairs.  We had low chairs. By the time you get to the register you have to give them your table number and know what you'd like to order and pay there.  We went with a Cubana sandwich and my wife had a watermelon and goat cheese salad with a guacamole with bacon and queso fresco to start.  We also ordered churros and my wife wanted a coffee but not until we were done our mains.The guacamole was ok.  I can't say it was amazing.  The chips were good and they also came with a couple different salsas as well.My sandwich was good but not great.  The bread I'm used to being more crusty and toasted more than it was.  This is a standard for just about any Cuban sandwich I've ever had in Miami or just about anywhere that wants to make it as should be.  Their torta simply wasn't as good as I'm used to and generally speaking every place in Miami does it the way I was expecting it to be.  My wife's salad was a disappointment for her that or it simply wasn't what she was expecting.  She was expecting way more watermelon than she received (only about 5 small pieces) and there was barely any goat cheese in her salad.  I looked at it and it was rather sad looking.  It definitely wasn't worth 11 dollars.We ate all our guacamole and mains and we had asked to receive our dessert.  I had asked for a single chocolate and peanut churro and my wife had the trio of regular cinnamon and sugar with her chocolate cafe con leche.  The coffee I tried and it was really good.  Honestly I think Xoco's strong suit is the churros and coffee.  The food was in my opinion nothing really special.Rick Bayless or not I've had better torta in Miami at walk up places and for me the bread is the maker or breaker for sandwiches.  My wife's salad seemed ""skimped"" to say the least.  The churros and coffee however are as we remember them, great.","9/9/2015","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw","Lambert P."

"Walked in on a Friday night -Line had about 15 people, place was pretty full and cozy. Girl at the register offered to take my order and seat me pretty quick (totally skipped the line, yooohooo!)Ordered:FRIDAY SPECIAL: CHIPOTLE SHRIMP - Had a pretty strong ""sea"" taste but the avocado-tomatillo salsa made it pretty good.NICHOLS' FARM PUMPKIN SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM- Very yummy with a kick of cinnamon, puts you right in the mood for fall :)SHOT OF DIPPING CHOCOLATE- Very thick and bitter, perfect for anyone that loves REAL chocolate.CHOCOLATE CAFÉ CON LECHE- Standard cafe con leche with a dash of chocolate thrown in, nothing too special. Was a little bummed that it wasn't served hot (it's cold out here y'all!) but just kinda warm.*Was a bit disappointed that the churro machine was broken so I wasn't able to order any, but just more reason to come back! The service was supér, the staff was very attentive A+.Total cost about $26 with tip.","10/21/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=a2AaMA3IH3w3MBOTZ1I9eQ","Jennifer C."
"YUM! Pretty darn cheap, but tasty enough to cost WAY more. We split the loaded guac which was full of interesting toppings. I had the short rib soup and my husband had a torta. Both were excellent! I certainly would not call this 'traditional' Mexican cooking, but definitely pulls from a traditional flavor profile","4/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=poWG-zIGhJC8J5uTecR-bg","Sarah M."

"Well...in the words of my friend as we left...""that was rough."" I had never been to a Rick Bayless restaurant, and I was really looking forward to it. The consensus when we left was that this would be a great place for take-out (which they have), but dining in wasn't great, especially with a big group.The venue itself is small. There are a lot of seats around the perimeter of the room (like a bar setting, and very few tables. There are no reservations to be made. You can show up early and tell the hostess that you will have guests showing up,  but you can't sit at the table until people start to arrive. We were pretty cramped by the time we sat down, but it worked. You can order and then sit down, and they will bring your food to you, or they will wait on you. I was little confused by this...so we have a waiter or we don't? The wait staff was very nice and tried to be accommodating when we first got there. Towards the end of the night, the service wasn't so good. A few orders were forgotten or messed up (they did make up for that). We waited a long time for checks and getting out. We wished we would have just ordered and sat down.As far as good and drinks go, overall it is very good. The guac is really good, as well as the 2 salsas they give you. The tacos al pastor (only served on Wednesdays) are also good. I really liked their churros with chocolate dipping sauce and Mexican chocolate ice cream. Really different and really good. The margaritas...I was not a fan. It tasted like there was a ton of salt in the drink, which I don't like. they are also really expensive for how small they are.So...I would go back for take-out. I still want to try Rick's other restaurants (right next door). But I probably would not dine-in again.","2/19/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UuIr2WKA0gZRyRvWIlAduQ","Danielle S."
"I got the spicy peanuts as an appetizer which were amazing. The peanuts were still crunchy and the spices didn't over power the taste of the nuts.I got the short rib soup with green beans and zucchini. The soup was hot and had great flavor. Unfortunately there wasn't enough veggies/short rib in the soup for me. If they threw some more short rib and veggies into this meal I would easily give 4 stars. Would go back to try other things on the menu.","5/7/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y9t-9wqiPvTrjvw6RCTmmg","Reid C."
"I have not tried their food much so this is a review for their deserts and hot chocolate. Xoco is one of the best places for hot chocolate in Chicago. I never knew how good it can be till I had this! Try any of their Mexican hot chocolates and you will know what I mean. I highly recommend this place.","10/25/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qEuwp5hIEL8RbuyT1tWY0g","Shahzad A."
"Really great authentic Mexican, that is really well priced. Nice format: order at the counter, choose your seat (indoor or outdoor) and they bring the food to you. Our drinks were refilled often, as the staff was very attentive. We started with chicharrones and the fully dressed guacamole. I had the summer carnitas torta and my colleague had the carne asada. We finished with churros with chocolate sauce. If you only go for one thing go for the churros, better yet just stop in any time for them.I'll be back to Chicago and I will definitely be back to Xoco.","9/19/2015","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MUNkLcIm6nOVoGWZ7w3ecA","Angela C."

"First the food the pork belly,  tortilla, cheese, gravy with onions, and jalapeños on top, was an explosion in my mouth.  I've never had Mexican food that wasn't too something, too spicy, too greasy, too sweet,  but this dish was perfect it was savory and flavorful  a little spicy and if you wanted jalapeños they were on top not in the dish.  I can handle a little spicy at I was skeptical coming here but curiosity won out and my taste buds are thankful.  The churo was ok the Aztec hot chocolate which has spices in it was bitter the churo dipped into the chocolate was amazing, so these two should only be ordered together. Second the service I hope the cashier must be new but she had this additude that seemed like she didn't want to be there.  You order at the register first then the bring it out to you but there's no one checking on you out there, it was different in that it was relaxing dispite the jackhammer going off     across the street TGFE (thank God for ear buds).  I asked for my churo and chocolate to come later yet no one came to ask if I was ready for it and I'm pretty sure that they can see you through the windows. The food was so good that the lack of service deducts one star.","6/17/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ssA9zc9BNmZYa2amgCem8Q","LeRoya S."

"Good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner...this is one of my favorite places in Chicago. The sandwiches are to DROOL for. The toasty bread is what makes it in my opinion. Seriously, you could put anything in between those to slices and it would be good. Fortunately, xoco fills your torta with great combinations of meats, veggies, and sauces.The ahogada is the best sandwich on their menu, but if it's saturday, you should probably take advantage of the goat barbacoa - the sandwich of the day.Don't forget about breakfast either! Holy crap there's so much good stuff before 10am. Again, if it's Saturday (before 10am) get the enchiladas!","2/8/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=icDPVdDIBLWSX_8hClrM9Q","Dan L."
"This delicious location just a handful of blocks from the Merchandise Mart makes me one very happy girl. And churros. They have churros. I mean, come on, didn't you see this solid 4 star review coming from a mile away? So, yes, Bayless did just dandy when it comes to all things Xoco. I love the concept - fresh Mexican (street eats) that lean towards the more casual tortas, guac, soups, etc, all made quickly and perfect for takeaway. All that being said, my buddy Corey and I still sat inside and enjoyed our lunch. First of all, the naked guac was pretty fabulous - incredibly fresh and flavorful and perfect with my fresh juice. However full you may be, start with some guac, my friends. When it comes to the menu, I've got to be honest, I wasn't totally bowled over by my main order - the ahogada. I should have read the description closer as the sandwich comes with a *very* spicy broth and not only am I not crazy about dipped sandwiches in general, but more so, my mouth was absolutely on fire. And I can handle heat. So there's that.Even though the sammie wasn't my fave, the grilled pork was flavorful and delicious, and everything I sampled was super solid. I'm looking forward to my Xoco visit and getting through more of the menu! PSA: Xoco is pronounced SHO-ko...and it means Little Sister.","7/19/2015","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q","Nicole W."
"Underwhelmed is how I would describe our experience at Xoco.  I was expecting the food here at one of Rick Bayless's restaurants to be INSANELY good!!  Instead, we received only good food.  Bottom line was that the food (for the most part) did not meet our expectations.Chips and salsa were a good start to our meal.  Fresh and tasty! (3.5 stars)Goat Barbacoa sandwich tasted bland.  From the bread to the goat meat, it was disappointing. (2 stars)Ahogada sandwich tasted better than the Goat Barbacoa.  Everything about it was quite flavorful.  Disappointed, though, that it did not taste as satisfying as my hometown food truck/trailer.  No ""Wow"" factor!  (3 stars)Glazed Churros were delicious!  The Hazelnut and the Pistachio churros did meet my expectations!  The best churros that I have ever eaten.  I would return for those sweet treats!  (5 stars)As I mentioned earlier, Xoco did not meet our expectations.  If I lived in Chicago, then I would try their sandwiches again cause maybe their chefs that day were having an off day.  As a tourist, I would not dine here again because there are so many restaurants yet to try.  Correction, I would return for their Hazelnut and/or Pistachio glazed churros. :)","1/17/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg","PatrickJ T."

"Pro tips from a 2nd time visitor: You should order the espresso, it's good. But after you pay, you have to request that they start it up for you, they don't just bring it to the table.Similarly, you're gonna get thirsty chomping down on that Ahogada at the #3 spice level. Water is self-serve, friendo! Consider yourself warned.Eh, I was going to review the sandwich, but I can see that 3000 of my closest friends already have. The food is divine. Rick Bayliss is divine. The 5-star reviews you read here are true. This place is always packed when I go, and it's tiny, but I don't even mind because the food is that good.","9/9/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0wpTeN2B2Vhk4fGy5GPLVw","Joe J."
"Got the Ahogada based on other yelp reviews (it isn't something I would typically order.) It was good, but a bit too salty for my taste. The bread was perfection, I do have to say. I wouldn't order it again though.The churros though...fanfrickintastic. I got it plain, no chocolate sauce and I still thought it was phenomenal. I got there at 6pm on a weekday and there was no line whatsoever.Would I come back? Yes. I'm curious to try the other menu items....To be continued....","2/10/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sL5FKA-L_CEQsAYm2WQ0kQ","Caryn R."
