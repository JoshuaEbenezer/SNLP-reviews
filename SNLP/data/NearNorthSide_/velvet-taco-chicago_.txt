Located at a prime location of the Gold Coast, Velvet Taco is a great place to check out if you're in the area. They have a very creative menu of tacos. Here is what I ordered, ranked by tastiest first.1. Spicy tikka chicken -- tikka masala seasoned chicken, basmati rice (!), thai basil. I love chicken tikka in general, and I love tacos. This was a winning combo! The basmati rice in the taco was interesting, but really creative and good2. Buffalo chicken -- crispy, buffalo-style chicken tenders, buffalo sauce, bleu cheese crumbles, ranch, garnished with carrots. Love me some buffalo chicken, and you can't go wrong with bleu cheese. It was this or the spicy tikka chicken taco that was hard to pick, in terms of favorite. I have to knock this down a little because it was too salty for me. 3. Kobe burger -- kobe beef mix, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle. Really good! The beef was cooked in a way where it was just really tasty. And I'm not a big pickle person, but the julian-cut style pickle was really good... it had a unique brine taste that I loved4. Slow roasted angus brisket -- brisket, red chile mayo, avocado relish, cheese, cilantro. Cooked in a barbacoa style. I love brisket in general, but this concoction was not my favorite. It was somewhat tarty for me, so can't say I loved itTots with egg -- tots with cheese, avocado cream, bacon, topped with an over-easy egg. This looked good from the pictures, and was somewhat good. The egg-white part of the egg could have been runnier; it was a little hard to get some of that yummy egg-white with the tot, but overall, still a delicious side.The place had two floors, so plenty of seating! The top floor was pretty cool, with seats facing out the window. Perfect for a warm Chicago day.BATHROOM REVIEW: Reviewing the top-floor bathroom, it consisted of a single-person bathroom, that had a strong flushing toilet, although I feel like the toilet was slightly low. Everything was in working order, faucet was somewhat weak in the hot water, adding cold water didn't make the water pressure any better. Sit or squat?

This was before I was a vegetarian but I still remember that I was surprised at how great the meat was instead of the fake rubbery stuff a lot of places use to cut corners.

That being said, if you're from out of town, and what to try a fun spot (or need a drunk food option after going out), definitely come here.Here's the food rundown:*So, generally speaking, I actually think their sides are WAY better than the tacos themselves.Tater Tots: Tater tots, with bacon and an egg on top. This is drunk food at it's finest.Red Curry Corn Queso: Sounds kinda weird, but actually my favorite item on their menu. THIS is definitely an innonvative dish.Spicy Chicken Tikka: Great flavor on the taco. Spicy, but not too much so.Rotisserie Chicken: Also good flavor.Here's where the good ends...Paneer: Two soggy, drippy pieces of paneer on a tortilla. No thanks.Falafel: Their falafel is just not up to par. Lacks flavor like a lot of their other tacos, and doesn't have that nice crunch that we all so desperately desire in a falafel.Fish & Chips: Bland, fried peice of fish on a tortilla. No thanks x2.Shrimp & Grits: Heavy & unflavorful. Side note: They do have boxed wine to go...

Velvet Taco is one such place. It's amazing in so many levels. On a Saturday night, which also happened to be the night of St Patrick's Day celebrations, we headed here for dinner. It was crowded and the queue to place your order was really long. They have an option of online orders which would work much better in a situation like this. I can see it being crowded on a regular day too, I see why. It's a really hip place with inventive interiors, communal tables and wall arts. They have a two floor seating and the second floor is a little less noisy as the orders are placed in the first floor. They serve delicious tacos, not necessarily the most authentic ones. That's what worked for me the most! The menu is categorized based on the meat that goes in the making of tacos. We ordered Fried Paneer, Nashville Hot Tofu and Falafel Tacos. I also got a Frozen Margarita. The tacos were delicious, very innovative flavors. For my favorites list, I am still deciding between Paneer and Tofu tacos, but I definitely feel that Tofu Taco won me over. Falafel was my least favorite and I may not order that again. It was served on a Lettuce Wrap unlike the other two that were served on Flour Tortilla. The place is reasonably priced.

I even order delivery. So you can say I know how the food tastes, how the portions should be, etc.I came in with my brother and wanted him to try the tots, so we got an order to share along with four tacos and a lemonade. Everything was good, as usual, except for the tots. They were really over cooked (really, really crispy, not fluffy in the middle like they usually are), so I went to the counter and let them know my problem, and asked for them to be remade. The guy at the counter was really nice, but said that's how they usually are. I understand he works there and probably eats there more than me, but ALL of the other times I came here it was not like that. All of the other times they were perfect, and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. I told him I would like them less cooked then, and this is where it took a turn for the worse.The cook, OLIVER, was extremely rude. He looked at me and asked, \"What? Do you want them raw?\" in a very annoyed tone. I have never experienced such horrible customer service and I eat out like 5 times a week. I wasn't even talking to him, and he had the nerve to address me as if I offended him. I asked for his name, in which he replied, and when I said okay and walked back to my table, he laughed at me. The only joke was his horrible attitude.The guy behind the counter was really apologetic about his rude co-worker, so kudos to him, but he shouldn't have to apologize for other people's crappy attitudes and lack of respect. I paid for the food, so I should have the food how I want. And that's not me being bratty. I work at a restaurant-type place, and whenever a customer isn't satisfied, I get them a replacement or have it remade. And not just for good customer service, but because they paid for the food! And they should have it how they want if it's possible! Geesh.*deep breath*Anyways, enough ranting, and on to the food:Picnic tacos: I LOVE THESE! The crispy skin, potato cubes, and avocado crema is what make this. It's so delicious and so filling. I get this every single time. 5/5Pork belly tacos: I guess they discontinued this, which is sad, but this was also one of my favorites. I love pork belly, and I love house pickled veg, so this was my ish. Too bad, so sad. 5/5Rotisserie chicken tacos: This is fresher and lighter than the other tacos, but still equally pretty darn good. If you want something a bit fresher because of the salsas/picos, then maybe this one is for you. 4/5Cuban pig tacos: This is aiiight. Edible but not particularly yummy to me. Too much going on. 2/5Tots: YUMM! I'm obsessed with potatoes. Potatoes are life. Potatoes are love. I'm one of those. Hashbrowns, fries, wedges, tots, I don't discriminate. But the egg, and bacon, and tots, and crema, and micro greens.. I can't. 5/5Corn: This is pretty good, but I get it only if I'm really wanting to pig out. I like the unique twist, and the lime wedge that comes with it. 4/5I really want to try their veg options, but honestly, I probably won't be back for a while. While I ranked most of their food highly, I still have a bad taste in my mouth after the interaction with their cook. A lot of the experience is not only good food, but how the customer left feeling.

All smushed tater tots with tiny pieces of super salty thin jerky-like bacon.#20 roast pork frittata. I can't remember, but I'm sure I liked it.Will be trying out the rest soon! Tips for business:1) just a tad bit more meat in tacos [for the price]2) have a sign on the right side that says \"pickup\" (unless I missed it), or tell people calling in for pickups to skip the line and head straight to counter. The line was a bit long, and by the time we got to the counter, the cashier said \"oh you're order is already ready\". Our tacos were soggy and sweating, albeit tasted delish. 2.5) to-go items' boxes shouldn't be fully closed until picked up, to avoid sweating. 3) more practical for to-go orders to be labeled.

They have an Asian style taco, and Indian taco and even a southern style taco. While the tacos are a little pricey, they are totally worth it. My absolute favorite taco is the Tikka Masala. For any who loves chicken tikka masala at an Indian restaurant, imagine that on top of a bed of basmati rice and in a taco. Delicious!!! Another great taco is the flank steak taco with portobello mushrooms and quest fresco. I could seriously eat 100 of those. Finally velvet taco also always has a special taco that is always great! This weeks taco was a calamari taco with a mango salsa on top. So good and the sweet flavor of the salsa mixed with the salty fried flavors of the Calamari were the perfect balance. For a first timer, I highly suggest getting a bunch and trying them all.

The crisp tenders are coated with creamy crema and spicy pepper sauce, which had a nice kick to it. This taco is not for the carb-avoider as it is also served with basmati rice!The crisp pork belly was a close second - the pork belly fat must have been rendered at a low temperature for quite some time because it was so melt-in-your-mouth succulent and juicy. I liked how it was paired with pickles and fresno chili peppers for some acidity to cut through the fat. I also tried the picnic chicken, which was perfect in terms of how tender the chicken was.

I started with the poke taco because poke is always a good life choice - and it held true here. Though not a traditional taco, this was every bit as satisfying as my other tacos - the poke was plentiful, and the cilantro and sea salt were perfect accompaniments that didn't overly complicate the goodness of the poke.

VT's tacos did not disappoint. We got order ahead carry-out and it was ready right on time and all packaged tremendously thoughtfully. I got the shrimp and grits taco and the chicken tikka taco. Both were quite delicious. The shrimp and grits taco basically had a 'bar' of crispy grits in the bottom of the taco (they should probably sell the crispy grits solo as a side, just sayin') topped with a generous helping of tender, well-seasoned shrimp, a tangy and delicious tomato relish, and a remoulade sauce. \u00a0Oh! And how could I forget the corn tortilla! It definitely seemed homemade and was spot-on. I would certainly order it again. The chicken tikka was also yummy and novel- breaded chicken, buttered basmati rice, Thai basil, and tikka sauce. I enjoyed it, but the breaking to chicken ratio felt a little off to me and I would've preferred it a little meatier. \u00a0It wasn't disappointing, but I won't be ordering it again. That being said, it's my friend's favorite and she's ordered it again and again, so it may just be a preference thing. The winner of the meal was the tots though. Good heavens, those tots. The tots themselves were super crispy, even to go. The toppings sounded a bit like a hodgepodge in the description (avocado cream AND herbed goat cheese??) but they know what they're doing. The spicy sauce that accompanies them provides the perfect tang to cut through the otherwise gluttonous portion. And \u00a0the egg was perfectly cooked.

The fillings are generally fresh and range from traditional to inventive. The service, while not exactly friendly, gets the job done. But not everything tastes all that good at the end of the day. The shrimp and grits taco was a bit of a dud. The tomato-based cajun sauce was ordinary, and the balls of fried grits on a tortilla is just too much. The picnic chicken was much better: tender and juicy and loaded up with fresh shucked corn and salsa. The annatto shredded pork would have been good, except the hibiscus tortilla, while pretty, just doesn't work. It tastes like a scented candle. The steak was beefy, chewy, and nicely charred, though I didn't get the balance of flavors the other toppings (portabello, fresh oregano) promised.Resonably priced considering it's more gourmet than your typical taco place.

The fish & chips taco was my favourite out of the ones that I tried. It was crunchy, fresh, and tangy. The chicken rotisserie was my least favourite. It was rather bland. There's an initial spicy kick to it, but beyond that, not much flavour. However, the chicken wasn't dry and prepared well. The pork belly taco was good. It had a great crispness to it and rich.

I ordered the buffalo chicken taco and the rotisserie chicken and man oh man were they delicious, so the $4 price tag on each of these babies didn't disappoint. The tacos were very flavorful, with different spicy,tangy sauces and a nice size too. You can easily get full off two tacos here. Their house margaritas are amazing! They are frozen with some major kick. With a price tag of $6 downtown on rush street, that I would say is considered a deal. There are still a few tacos I need to try off their menu and those tater tots everyone was ordering looked absolutely delicious too.

These are not your regular taco's but an upscale gourmet version. I was annoyed that there wasn't at least one \"normal type of taco\" for my less than adventurous friend, The place was very clean, and had a mix of people. The Heat sauce is as flavorful as it is spicy. 3 tacos and a slice of cake cost close to $20, it is not way overpriced, just not average. Set your sights high and prepare to spend $$ They have beer and drinks and they sell Hamms and Modelo, Seriously Hamms? That beer is terrible. These aren't old school tacos so why pretend to be old school with the beer have something drinkable, enjoyable. such as HalfAcre GoneAway IPA.For a real treat ask for a #12, #13, #15 or #18.

Boy was everyone right! We went to check this place out last Friday around 630PM. Even though it packed, the serve was pretty quick. Low down:- Order at the cashier and get a number.- Grab a seat and wait for your food.Everything on the menu sounded mouthwatering and it was hard to just limit myself. We ended up getting a good selection including some the cashier recommended:#17 Ahi Tuna - Light and oh so good. Being on a diet and eating out is very difficult, however with the substitution of a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla was perfect for me. I was a huge fan of the seaweed salad. Refreshing and tangy. Definitely my favorite on the menu,#6 Falafel - Also came with a lettuce wrap, which is why I ordered it. Sometimes falafel is too salty for me, but this one was on point. The tahini crema was not heavy and had a good tangy to it. #14 Shrimp & Grits (cashier recommendation) - This was one big taco. My friend enjoyed it very much. She said the grits had a lot of layers in flavor.#3 Spicy Tikka Chicken (cashier recommendation) - I don't know about you, but this was the best of both worlds, Indian food meets Mexican food. This was pretty awesome. Literally butter chicken in taco form. Just a little kick to it, but nothing overwhelming.#11 Grilled Flank Steak (cashier recommendation) - The steak was cooked perfectly and was not dry. My friend said the grilled red onions and the portobello made the steak juicy. Crisp tots & local egg - Big enough to share with 2-3 people per the cashier and he was right. Everything about this side dish is out of this world! I am pretty particular with my tots, they NEED to be crispy. If you are like me, then you don't have to worry because these tots were definitely crispy. I was worried the egg would make the tots soggy, but it didn't. When we broke the yolk, it just made the whole dish come together. On top of all this, there is bacon too! Just as crispy and with the cheese, life just made sense at that moment.Overall, I am so glad I spend my first cheat day eating here. First cheat day in 3 weeks and it was so well worth it. For someone like me, who doesn't ever crave Mexican, this place changed me. With such a unique selection of tacos that I have never seen or tasted before, I find myself drawn how they turn quality and flavor in their food in such a short amount of time. What a great addition to the neighborhood. Located in my old stomping grounds, Gold Coast, where I used to attend grammar school. Back in the day, students had the privilege of going off campus for lunch, and if this place was around, I would be here everyday! The only negative thing I can say about this place is why didn't it open sooner?! \u00a0Anyways, here's to hoping they will offer new tacos for the fall/winter or MAYBE open a spot in Andersonville.
