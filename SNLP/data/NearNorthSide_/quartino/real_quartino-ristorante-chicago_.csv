"This review is all about the food.  The food here is possibly the blandest I've ever tasted.  I'm not sure what went wrong in the kitchen, but I'm hoping the cooks were on vacation and valets were in the kitchen.  I honestly don't know how you f&*&( Italian food so bad. I've never left a bad review for a restaurant or product in my life until now.  So believe me when I say -- try somewhere else.  Also, who are these people pouring 5 star reviews on this place? Really sad for them.","2/17/2017","1.0 star rating","v_3Z0xwm48lNvi7R5uqUsA","Gerry H."
"Our group of 5 dined here last night and all left extremely disappointed! The restaurant was packed and very loud as it was a Saturday night. This was to be expected in Chicago in the summer. The food was fair to bad. We ordered 9 different small plates and each was lacking in flavor and prepared poorly by Chicago restaurant standards. We ordered Burrata, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Broccoli Rabe, Octopus, Shrimp Risotto, Calamari, Tuscan Kale salad and the Cavetelli. The cheeses were all very bland and tasteless, the seafood chewy, and the pastas gummy. We have been waiting to try this restaurant for months as it is consistently crowded and well reviewed. We left thinking we will never go back and wondering why it is so popular. Go to RPM Italian or Eataly nearby and get MUCH better Italian food. Even Maggiano's is better!","9/4/2016","1.0 star rating","MHTassewXbjcjpWsl_z6QA","Charlotte R."
"My family had gotten here and had to wait an hour for a 20 minute wait. Book reservations if you stay or else you are going to starve. The service was average and so was the food. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody who is very hungry, but if you are able to wait half an hour to a n hour, this is a mediocre place to eat.","12/18/2015","1.0 star rating","vaRW2cD-fy6J2UdIYUewtg","Jordan J."
"This experience deserves a zero. First of all our main meal was brought out before our starters and had to send it back which they put on hold. About an hour later after we were forgotten about they brought our pasta with meat sauce and it tasted like bad bland leftovers. Once two tables of bridal shower guests arrived we were completely ignored. Will never go back, worst experience ever!","8/9/2015","1.0 star rating","Di_VdyjkzxumIDtTcbZGjg","Carol D."

"I do not understand the 4 & 5 star reviews here. We had a large group in a private room upstairs for dinner and while the service was good, the food was fair at best.  The 2 pastas I tried were boring and flavorless.  The salmon tasted like olives and nothing else. The filet was fair. The chicken was ok but rather dry and boring. The bruschetta was not great...the bread wasn't even toasted. And the fondue that people rave about? It was awful. The biscotti was so hard it was impossible to break it into pieces to dip in the chocolate. The strawberries were horrible looking. The pears and apples were ok.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone.","10/10/2014","1.0 star rating","D75msiC3eadctJy8XHBEcw","Carolyn S."

"Saturday night... Jan 8.... Out for a friends birthday.... We are local guys.... Have to wait for every girl at the bar to get served before a bartender will even look at you.... And once they do, a super weak drink for a too high price.... Also 45 minute wait for a reservation past time.....

"This is not a place to go if you have a large group.  We had a reservation for 15.  We arrived and waited an hour past our reservation time to be seated.  (It was a Wednesday night.)  They told us everyone in our party had to be present, and would not seat us, despite having a large enough table open.  It would have been easy to take a smaller table away if everyone did not show up (and they could have sold quite a bit of food and alcohol to the table in that time).  The food at Quartino is good, stay away if you're more than 4 people.","7/8/2009","1.0 star rating","Jjl5ckgY6cT9w7UqAOXs7g","Jeremy P."
"The service was terrible. We had reserved a table for 8 and when we showed up there was 6 of us (2 were running late). They didn't explain to us that we had to wait for all of our party to be present to be seated, so the table wasn't large enough and then they told us there would be a half an hour wait (making it 45 minutes after the reservation we made).  None of us had dined here before and our waitress (who looked very sloppy) explained to us that everything was meant to be a sharing plate, we must have misunderstood her, and some of us shared just one entree. But the plates were very small and we ended up with a lot less food then we wanted. The food wasn't great either. The spinach pizza was just a pile of spinach with a flavorless sauce on top of flatbread. The lamb was $17 with no sides, and was equally flavorless.","3/1/2009","1.0 star rating","_dyAA4-JzbIOBjesk5KmbA","Lauren W."
"Mushy bland risotto and over cooked pasta.  Disappointing after reading the positive reviews.  Even the bread was boring.

"I was in the city for my birthday, our taxi driver recommended this place...poor choice.  My server was ok...and I felt rushed to order. I was disappointed in the fact that they ""ran out of shrimp,"" on a Saturday night. The calamari was good but a little salty for my liking.  I ordered the beef filet medium and it arrived well done...  The veal osso buco was good but the price was a little high for the portion.  Yes, it's a tapas restaurant but you will have to order two of everything to serve four people....unless you want pizza.  The place was really loud and we weren't allowed to sit outside b/c of the city ordnance, which closes the outside patio at 12:00am...","5/29/2016","2.0 star rating","ZA7YCMzS4S8ni3w3-9FFPg","Mahubah A."

"The quality of food in a restaurant is important to me- but, unfortunately for Quartino, the friendliness of staff and overall service are equally important. The service here is what will prevent me from coming back or recommending this restaurant, as the food was not good enough to redeem it.We felt like an afterthought in this establishment. Having one's party stuck at a table wedged between a stair rail and a hutch, nearly directly above a flight of stairs, on the immediate path to the bathroom, and completely separated from the rest of the crowd, smacks of discrimination. We did not look quite like the other patrons- not when we walked in, and certainly not while sitting down.As evidenced by her gesturing toward us and eye-rolling in conversation with coworkers, our server did not appreciate that we were occupying the table post-dinner and wine consumption (please note that she must have wanted to leave, as there were many empty tables at this time). Perhaps space and time are what we were paying for, though, given that the food was just OK and not quite worth its price. But really, I was just trying to enjoy friends that I hadn't seen in a long time. I will find another place to do this in the future.I will concede that the variety of items on the menu was nice. The food was fine- but again, it does not compensate, and it will not be missed.","3/18/2014","2.0 star rating","WTSu6cCeM56-CRCyOV__7A","Edie D."
"Complete Tourist Attraction!Great location and atmosphere. I drive by everyday and the restaurant is always full.The menu is great and the servers are well trained however the food is terrible. My partner and I ordered 5 separate dishes to share and were not impressed with a single one. Some we couldn't even finish. The only reason I would give it two stars was because our server was absolutely excellent. However despite the great service, I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone simply based on the food alone.","10/8/2013","2.0 star rating","QoyfwG_dT2w350fyEJQ3lw","David S."
"This place is a 5 STAR restaurant.  Everything kicks ass about this place.  Until I saw an employee use the bathroom and leave without washing his hands.  I think he was a bus boy.  When I got done washing my hands, I saw him outside the restroom, and I said hey buddy, you should wash your hands.  And he got upset and said you don't know what job I do out here in a foriegn voice.  Bus boy or not, he brings me water and silverware, that's the last thing I need is his little penis germs around my food.  I'm gonna go back, but please, someone smack them bus boys around.","10/1/2013","2.0 star rating","ZN5pE-3fEskEhy-IQ1uhEA","Chicago D."

"I had family here from out of town and was very excited to take them here since my previous experience was so great. This time around our service was not horrible but not very enjoyable either. One of my cousins forgot her ID and the majority of our stay she felt uncomfortable Bc our server kept peeking over to see if she was drinking. She also had a bit of a attitude when she was taking orders and ignored my other cousin when she asked for more bread or didn't respond at all. But the worst part was the staff party and side work that was going on just a few feet away from us. It made us extremely uncomfortable and totally shocked that the staff was basically having dinner and social hour just a table away. Working in restaurants for years this was never something that was done in front of customers. We are not only paying for the food but also the experience and atmosphere. Our experience was one that was not really enjoyable. I was pretty dissapointed and embarrassed by the way the place is ran. I actually snapped some good pics and one of the manager chowing down.","11/22/2011","2.0 star rating","ETrBLV0sNptImeoC3DB3Ng","arianna B."
"I'm not going to lie. This place has very good food, but the service is pretty much garbage. I took my girlfriend here for a little birthday dinner and was pretty pissed off the whole night. I was served first (main dish) and had to ask the waiter if my girlfriends dish was ready as well. They took my dish back, warmed it up, and brought both of ours back together. The waiter offered us desert on the house. When I made the reservation I asked for a candle to be with any desert we ordered since it was her birthday. We got the desert, which was OK i guess, we got the candle in the desert, but it was put on the table without it being lite. HAHA WTF? The only thing we could do was laugh, honestly. I flagged down the waiter again and he said "" they didnt light it"" ???!!-I'll be back for some food MAYBE but I don't expect much else.","9/13/2011","2.0 star rating","_0cXc8UD6ZP3mRPHHQ_-3Q","Nate N."
"The service was friendly but not super attentive. The food was simply mediocre. The bread was dry. Average. The table had a nice EVOO and sea salt for additional seasoning which is always nice - however it is accompanied by a sad, old school shaker of pepper. Romaine Hearts salad was fresh and well done. But the housemade Cavatelli was simply dry, chewy, lukewarm and bathed in a very average tomato sauce. The Asparagus Risotto was dry and goopy - the rice was literally crunchy on the inside. After the fully mediocre dinner, we chose the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake with vanilla gelato - as it's nearly impossible to mess up. It was exactly as expected. But you can microwave a brownie from a convenience store and put cheap ice cream on it and it'll be good. Their version was extremely sweet. Then someone randomly dropped off their housemade Tiramisu because it was plated by accident - and it too was mediocre. Dry seems to be the overall description of the food here. The ladyfingers were literally still crusty on the inside. Not a horrible place - but it certainly isn't the great place I was led to expect from the reviews on Yelp.","9/5/2011","2.0 star rating","UwI404NRlinOIdHCpf4ksQ","makin m."

"I came to Quartino with my mother on mothers day, expecting a 4 star experience as yelp claims it to be. We were sat at a table near the kitchen, which didn't bother me. Our server was very friendly, and did an excellent job. The portions were fair for the price, and the food really was nothing to complain about. The restaurant was packed as our server told us it always was, so the noise was nothing to complain about, it was expected. However, the noise that did bother me, but most importantly my mother, were the loud shouts of profanity we heard coming from the kitchen. As soon as the shouting ended, a character who appeared to be the head chef exited and began speaking with a table near us. It was then we realized this was the same guy who was doing the shouting. My mother was displeased for the rest of our meal, which all came out at once. Quartino has potential to be a great restaurant, but after seeing a chef at one minute shouting profanities, and the next minute pretending to be happy guy with the guests, i dont feel the overall environment has what it takes to be a favorite in my book. I must say i dont think i will be recommending Quartino to anyone anytime soon.","5/9/2010","2.0 star rating","bsQVFeLKiEWzvAipzGAmdg","Peter M."

"Dined here at 10pm on a Saturday night.  The place was packed.  My date and I had to yell back and forth to be heard.  Service was slow even after the crowd thinned out.  Had to ask our server many times for water refills, hot sauce and the check.  Each plate took quite awhile to prepare and arrive at our table.  Seemed overpriced to me but then again this is Chicago and the restaurant is on State street.$9 Calamari:  Average rubbery circles. Have had better. Bland sauce.  Try ""That Little Mexican Cafe"" calamari with salad.$9 Spaghetti with Arriabetta sauce.  Appetizer for one (almost.) This was great but no where near worth $9.  Maybe $3.50 or so.$21 Beef Fillets with broccoli rabe. Four small fillets...about the size of a childs palm.

"The Italian tapas idea is good, but we just weren't satisfied with this place. Even though the reviews claim you can eat and drink to your heart's extent for not much money, we plunked down almost $150 for four people and walked away hungry. We tried the wine (good), the bellinis (fair), and appetizers and entrees. The appetizers were OK. The veal sliders were the best thing we ordered, the calamari OK, but the mushroom bruschetta was bland. The risotto (we ordered two kinds) was soupy (both of them). The pasta was salty. The desserts were a mixed bag. The profiteroles were very good, but the carmelized banana dessert was short on the bananas, and had too much average, flavorless vanilla ice cream. I don't get the great reviews and the crowds of people waiting to get in. Go to any Francesca's restaurant for better food and cocktails, and try Palermo's on 95th and Cicero for a bargain Italian meal with great food. Just because a restaurant is in the city doesn't mean it's the better than what you can find in the 'burbs.","12/17/2008","2.0 star rating","ZeiMsRs6f0P-gQ7YT7_2Vw","MB S."

I expected better. Portions were not big, either, but I wasn't too hungry, so guess that was good because we were traveling. The pork shank, which someone else got, had a good flavor. Another bummer was that the NCAA men's hoop games were going on, yet we couldn't see them on the two TVs in the main dining area, even though we asked them to change it and no one was watching them.

"Full disclosure, I hate tapas and i was on I ridiculous first date.Quartino's is a busy place. Get a reservation or go  during off peak times.  They sat us by a busy server station but were amenable to moving us to a less trafficked area. Busy place, so if you aren't in the mood for a bit of bustle, go elsewhere.The pacing of the meal left much to be desired. We ordered all our food at once. Although we didn't specify, I was assuming we would receive it that way. My past came out first, a half order of the cavatelli.  I always box half of my pasta to take home so I'm pretty good at eyeballing portions.  This was a small half order.  Also, I asked to exchange the tomatoes with my salmon for broccoli. Apparently the wires got crossed, and the kitchen had added a few broccoli spears to this.  My date took a bite of my pasta and said it was ""nothing special"". Geez! I thought it was pretty good.13 minutes later (which is an eternity in bad date time) my dates chicken arrived. The gravy was tasty. He needed some potatoes. He proceeded to mop up said gravy w half a loaf of bread. Yikes.I eventually flagged the waiter down to ask after my salmon. He graciously offered a drink while we waited. A full 17 minutes later my salmon arrived,  with the tomatoes I didn't want! It was lovely and hot, delicious. My dog seemed to enjoy the tomatoes later...  ;)And then for dessert.  Gentlemen, if you insist that you are stuffed and couldn't possibly eat any dessert please leave us at least 50% of ours. This glutton ate 90% of my cake!   I couldn't really say much since the check had already arrived. This came with some delicious gelato.If I was rating just on taste I would give this place 4 stars. Add in the wine carafes and I would give it 4.5. But due to portions, crowding, and Really ridiculous timing, a 3 is more than fair.","2/18/2012","3.0 star rating","qfGOcAodQyoFx1qGMlVniA","Diana B."
"Ok, this place is just Ok.  If you are a girl from the suburbs and looking for a place to have an annoying bachelorette party... look no further.  Also, this place is pricey, don't be fooled by the ""small plates"" and small prices per plate, it adds up fast.  Pizza was nothing special, tried the Funghi one, the crust was average, I did enjoy some of the cheeses from the cheese selections.  Service was Ok, so over-all Ok.","11/17/2011","3.0 star rating","LTmlkcVF-SBF5wuqfBMY0g","Samuel P."

"I would bring out of towners looking for decent Italian food to Quartino.  They get to see downtown as well as get a small plate tour of Italy.  I've been here a few times, once for a Yelp office hours, which was located on the second floor in the semi-private area.The last time I went, we were greeted by about 6 people standing at the host stand.  It seemed a little overwhelming and a bit inefficient.  Was there absolutely nothing else for them to do?  It also took about a minute before we were even acknowledged.  When they finally did, we were told that if we wanted to eat now (about 330PM on a Saturday afternoon) that we would have to be gone in an hour.  What a nice way to make me feel welcome!!  Foodwise, most offerings are small plates as well as pizzas.  I like the Romaine hearts.  I usually don't order salads since I feel like I can make better ones at home, but a friend wanted to try it, so I had a few bites.  The dressing was lemony fresh and delicious.  It's served as whole Romaine leaves tossed lightly and topped with shaved parm.  When I met the chef at Localicious, I tried to get the recipe, but he wasn't sharing.  Basically, he said that everything comes from high quality ingredients from Italy.  I'll have to keep experimenting to get it down.Go with a large group and order several small plates for a fun night downtown.  Bonus - house wine is cheap!","5/17/2011","3.0 star rating","2XhPAY4ChEidTnZXhUYTmQ","Laura C."
"The atmosphere is amazing, and the service was excellent, adding to the overall energetic ambiance of this restaurant. The food is the the area that leaves many questions to Quartino's patrons. The margherita pizza, the calamari, and the organic veal skirt steak were full of wonderous flavor, but all of the pastas on the menu, the mushroom risotto, and minestrone soup were all relatively calm flavors reminding me of those that can be bought out of a can/jar at a local grocer. Im not convinced that any of the sauces were created by their chefs. These unsatisfying illusions led me to question the quality of the other items that I greatly enjoyed. Although maybe its just the foods with sauces.","8/21/2010","3.0 star rating","NsSyCurKXwYr326ImbyWUw","shaun w."

"Quartino was a nice local choice in the Near North River neighborhood near our hotel. The atmosphere and ambience deserves a 4.5-5, as it looks and feels like old world Italy. The service was also good, and at 1:30 on a Sunday in mid-July, there was no wait to sit inside. The bathrooms were clean and bright, and the noise level was very conducive to conversation.The pizza was very good, with a great crust and good favors. The penne was well done, but the ravioli was somewhat lacking in flavor and not done consistently...it seems they overlooked that part of the  order, then prepared it quickly to get it to the table. Decent variety of wines and bottled beer, with 7-8 on tap. Overall, an above-average to good experience, with the ravioli snafu being the only blemish. I would recommend Quartino if you're in the neighborhood or nearby area.","7/19/2016","4.0 star rating","-hNg6ke7igFaT0-JybCvIw","Steve L."

"This is an awesome Italian restaurant in Chicago ever! Great atmosphere, amazing chefs and amazing food. Custom make all or none of your order and the chefs will use their magic to make a memorable meal. Small plates can sometimes be annoying when you really want to enjoy a specific food -- but hey, for that why not just order more. My favorite is the cavatelli -- wife loves the since retired rigatoni in Alfredo sauce with broccoli, but we always custom request it anyways. The pizza with the fonduta is stupendous and the chocolate cake was holy molly. Stop reading and go already.

"We went here with my wife to have some delicious dishes; well good thing was we made it at the right place. The pizza are a little too large but great to share with three or more. Go early or have a reservation because it was slammed at quarter to six. You may try their desserts, i suggest.","2/4/2016","4.0 star rating","zh5d16eSJeDyF2stpywYhw","Bernard B."
"I thought the food was really good. There are some reviews that complain about it being not that good. I don't know what they got but my meal was delicious. The portions are a little smaller then I would like but that does not break it for me.","1/11/2016","4.0 star rating","pru1JsEvvyopTjvNETOnwQ","Shannon W."
"LOVE the tortellini dish with peas and cream sauce.  The outside patio is great in the summer time.","12/10/2015","4.0 star rating","dtBJjvHAN2DrzNTCb6yZjQ","Maria P."
"Perfect spot for a group dinner. I have been here 8-10 times.  Most spots of the restaurant are rather energetic/loud, so may not be an ideal spot if you're looking for an intimate atmosphere.  Sound travels rather well even to the upstairs area that appears more intimate.The food and wine are great.  I have yet to meet a dish I did not enjoy.","12/9/2015","4.0 star rating","VOWnCEGo6lGu5mhEtZwJGA","Steve D."
"I celebrated my b'day here a few years ago. We had a table at the bar. Yea, it was noisy but that added to the fun. The small plates were perfect and enough to share. We just ordered in rounds of three and it was enough. The wine list was adequate. The waitress kept up with the rowdy bunch we became.","10/29/2015","4.0 star rating","bhBQ_xnHFtH3bCnhpJS15Q","Kym K."

"I have eaten at Quartino many times over the last 4 years and it has never disappointed.  This last time on the 17th was no different.  We had the Salumeria Tasting, and it was plenty for 5 people.  My husband has the beef short ribs and I had the Pappardelle.  Both were very good, flavorful and interesting.  We had a few carafes of wine and topped it off with Gran Coppa Quartino and homemade Limoncello.  It was all delicious.  You have to go to the place.  be prepared for LOUD.  But it's OK - it's fun.    The rest of our party when back a few nights later for an encore and said it was just as good.","8/24/2015","4.0 star rating","DcuyfjceK9jvCH7cKBRxZQ","Angie W."
"This place has some delicious food. Went out with a big group for my birthday, so we had quite the spread of small plates. There are so many options (which some may consider overwhelming). The beverages were quite tasty too. I was, however, not a fan of the lay out. It's a very cramped, loud space, so going to the bathroom (which is upstairs) was quite the chore. Wouldn't recommend for those who have trouble getting around or would like a quiet dinner.","8/21/2015","4.0 star rating","qWsgsLUzt9m9ck5ORKWqqQ","Izzy T."

"Quality service.  Nice all around menu.  Not the quietest place but we expected that.  If you're into small-plate Italian places this will fit you nicely.","8/20/2015","4.0 star rating","FW9ZeuGH476NjLmEg2z5zQ","Keith D."

"This place was great! I went there dinner with my BF and his whole family. Although it was a little cramped we still enjoyed our time here over the holidays.

"I was in town for a conference and came for dinner with a friend. We split a Salumerio tasting and a few orders of the veal meatball napoli, plus a cannoli for dessert. The meatballs were particularly excellent. We were seated on the balcony upstairs, which was lovely, and the service was friendly and prompt. It set the tone for a lovely conference with good friends.","11/15/2014","4.0 star rating","vsmbgEJvRbJ6ZrLoVbGUdA","Katherine C."

"I love that they serve different sizes of wine so you are not limited to a glass or a bottle. I also recommend their pizza - thin and crispy like you get in Rome. The Rucolina pizza is one of my favorites as it has arugula! Inside can be noisy and filled with bachelorette parties, especially on weekend nights.  I adore the vintage bathrooms but not the fact that they have bathroom attendants trying to get tips which I find awkward.","7/25/2014","4.0 star rating","6syAO2xr5TaFyMd6sycMgA","Natasha P."

"I tried this a few weeks ago with my girlfriend and I love it. The small plates are the perfect amount of food. We had shrimp, calamari, pizza, mushroom risotto and dessert. We loved it all.

"I ate here a few days ago for my birthday with my Boyfriend. Alot of people I know have been here and they said it's a good place to check out.First, why would anyone want to sit in the dining room when the bar is so awesome. It was a two hour wait in the dining room and it took us less than 3 miniutes in the bar. The bar is a unique area and I personally love it. All of the small plates were amazing and our bill was barely anything. Everytime I go to dinner and theres calamari on the menu, I order it. The sauce was so unique and flavorful. The bottle of wine we drank was delicious and so inexpensive. I think I finally found a perfect place to get a quick dinner and drinks.","4/8/2014","4.0 star rating","5uhysvROhpYsYA6jDyqaDg","Bianca P."
