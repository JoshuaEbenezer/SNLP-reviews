The restaurant was packed and very loud as it was a Saturday night. This was to be expected in Chicago in the summer. The food was fair to bad. We ordered 9 different small plates and each was lacking in flavor and prepared poorly by Chicago restaurant standards. We ordered Burrata, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Broccoli Rabe, Octopus, Shrimp Risotto, Calamari, Tuscan Kale salad and the Cavetelli. The cheeses were all very bland and tasteless, the seafood chewy, and the pastas gummy. We have been waiting to try this restaurant for months as it is consistently crowded and well reviewed. We left thinking we will never go back and wondering why it is so popular. Go to RPM Italian or Eataly nearby and get MUCH better Italian food.

We were sat at a table near the kitchen, which didn't bother me. Our server was very friendly, and did an excellent job. The portions were fair for the price, and the food really was nothing to complain about. The restaurant was packed as our server told us it always was, so the noise was nothing to complain about, it was expected. However, the noise that did bother me, but most importantly my mother, were the loud shouts of profanity we heard coming from the kitchen. As soon as the shouting ended, a character who appeared to be the head chef exited and began speaking with a table near us. It was then we realized this was the same guy who was doing the shouting. My mother was displeased for the rest of our meal, which all came out at once. Quartino has potential to be a great restaurant, but after seeing a chef at one minute shouting profanities, and the next minute pretending to be happy guy with the guests, i dont feel the overall environment has what it takes to be a favorite in my book.

The veal sliders were the best thing we ordered, the calamari OK, but the mushroom bruschetta was bland. The risotto (we ordered two kinds) was soupy (both of them). The pasta was salty. The desserts were a mixed bag. The profiteroles were very good, but the carmelized banana dessert was short on the bananas, and had too much average, flavorless vanilla ice cream.

We split a Salumerio tasting and a few orders of the veal meatball napoli, plus a cannoli for dessert. The meatballs were particularly excellent. We were seated on the balcony upstairs, which was lovely, and the service was friendly and prompt.

I also recommend their pizza - thin and crispy like you get in Rome. The Rucolina pizza is one of my favorites as it has arugula! Inside can be noisy and filled with bachelorette parties, especially on weekend nights. \u00a0I adore the vintage bathrooms but not the fact that they have bathroom attendants trying to get tips which I find awkward.", "review_date": "7/25/2014", "user_id": "6syAO2xr5TaFyMd6sycMgA", "user_name ": "Natasha P."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "Fun ambiance and great prices!", "review_date": "7/2/2014", "user_id": "_pc0qa0w9Y9Em0nNhZkPaw", "user_name ": "Oanh N."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "The dishes were perfect for sharing, everything was fresh and well made.", "review_date": "6/12/2014", "user_id": "0h07e9Istl3BQgkRygktBA", "user_name ": "Alex J."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "I tried this a few weeks ago with my girlfriend and I love it.

Alot of people I know have been here and they said it's a good place to check out.First, why would anyone want to sit in the dining room when the bar is so awesome. It was a two hour wait in the dining room and it took us less than 3 miniutes in the bar. The bar is a unique area and I personally love it. All of the small plates were amazing and our bill was barely anything. Everytime I go to dinner and theres calamari on the menu, I order it. The sauce was so unique and flavorful. The bottle of wine we drank was delicious and so inexpensive. I think I finally found a perfect place to get a quick dinner and drinks.", "review_date": "4/8/2014", "user_id": "5uhysvROhpYsYA6jDyqaDg", "user_name ": "Bianca P."}, {"review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "3/23/2011", "user_id": "KfZisjVrixHVWwYd8RHyjQ", "user_name ": "Big G."}, {"review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "8/7/2010", "user_id": "KfZisjVrixHVWwYd8RHyjQ", "user_name ": "Big G."}, {"review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "7/29/2012", "user_id": "IuSQZz72rGsVF9B1y_tBMw", "user_name ": "Adriane C."}, {"review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "3/31/2012", "user_id": "Rim4Lc3AKkqGs1eRk82jxg", "user_name ": "Mel L."}, {"review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "4/7/2011", "user_id": "MxJNXqanI2do0BOdvIVBZA", "user_name ": "Nick H."}, {"review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "9/14/2009", "user_id": "bSK2OG3jXdIEzyUv-wqbKw", "user_name ": "AMG S."}, {"review_rating": "3.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "7/2/2008", "user_id": "1LeteUCUZ23vSvrSY0d3Ig", "user_name ": "Jane S."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "11/17/2016", "user_id": "Mpu9_tiX9EauZyuNESs9QQ", "user_name ": "Edi U."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "11/26/2014", "user_id": "yVnX4TzFGFtnI3AvcIctzQ", "user_name ": "Van J."}, {"review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This review has been removed for violating our Terms of Service", "review_date": "7/21/2014", "user_id": "9Im0Ov0Jw96StDdQife8rA", "user_name ": "Jimmy J."}]
