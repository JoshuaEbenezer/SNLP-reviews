"I've never had a terrible experience with SafeHouse Chicago. This is my most loved area. I had one of the best dinners of my whole life here. We requested 6 distinct things from the menu to test an assortment of things. Staff is exceptionally knowledgeable about the wines they offer. They have given me some incredible suggestions in view of my depictions. The nourishment, administration, quality and amount are above what we at any point anticipated! Anticipating returning ASAP!","4/5/2017","4.0 star rating","8z12sBk5YDWoGJ7FYBdydw","Stephanie G."
"Sunday I decided to check out hot and new on Yelp. Safehouse caught my eye, was looking for bar food. I do not read reviews on new places cause half of them are fake. Saw no sign outside, just nice lettering saying 60 E Ontario. When I got there a young lady was in an office. Not going to say anymore about that. Food was very good, had the MOAB and onion rings. Side of cheese curds wow, recommended it to all my customers at my place of business. Great place for kids.","3/30/2017","4.0 star rating","u4lgnTEvJwKUz08IaKIeDw","Sal E."
"When we arrived the restaurant is full and was extremely busy and had to wait outside along with others however it was worth the weight. The burger was cooked to perfection and rosemary seasoned fries are brilliant.","3/29/2017","4.0 star rating","xpzyRnaikQ0RFLVniM-Y5g","William G. M."
"Got to visit this place recently and it is great! I thought it was a very unique and interactive restaurant. I enjoyed the drinks and ordered their steak along with a plate of nachos. I love how it's an underground spy themed location, especially when entering the restaurant and you have to either provide the secret password or have to do a small comical challenge. I noticed that one of the previous reviewers complained about not going to safehouse to play games, which is too bad because he should have either had a sense of humor or done his research on Safehouse. The young lady in the entrance did great with sticking to her character and got a good laugh out of my group and I.The hostess was very helpful and she remained patient with my group and I, despite a slight miscommunication on our behalf. The wait time wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, our waiter took our order and provided great service the rest of the time.My only complaint would be the wait time for food. My group and I waited about 40 minutes before being served our food. I do believe, however, the food was worth the wait.Overall, I enjoyed this place and will be coming back in the future. If you have a sense of humor and want an interactive experience that's more than your average restaurant/bar, I recommend Safehouse.","3/20/2017","4.0 star rating","SJl-gWG0zLiYH9aaM2SqUA","Vick M."
"We had a great time at The  Safehouse. We were very surprised to find out it has only been open for about 2 1/2 wks.  Our agent, Iron Mermaiden was great. She played the part very well, and kept us focused on our mission. Cool and unique dining experience.Mission accomplished,Agent Rockstar9 & Agent Baby Longneck","3/18/2017","4.0 star rating","TCjGqyuuzed94PbLb0ZDyA","Cathi A."

"Cue the swank James Bond theme music. This place is a diamond in the rough river north community. We stumbled upon their reviews and we had to try it. I think my girlfriend was invited to the soft opening as well.The pros: The décor is exquisite. It looks like a bomb shelter turned discotheque. The bartender or magician, was deep in bond character. I love his Fedora. Agent Xavier had my girlfriend and me chuckling at these camp tongue in cheek spy'linguistics. Plus he read our minds! And we're women not easy to do. He guessed the named of my first kiss and also guessed which drink I wanted. Way to go professor X, you madder our night. The White haired interrogator upstairs was amazing as well. We found out he wasn't even Australian! This man is hilarious once you find out it's all a put onThe multiple hats this crew wears is insane. I hope they're getting paid well. I think the staff is the BEST part of this brand.We tried a bacon onion burger and the cheese curds on Xavier's suggestion, he pushed them. So glad he did. They both were delicious! The cons: It's really hard to find. Maybe by design, to get the word of mouth on the streets? But have something a logo on the door or something. We arrived at 9 and wished there weren't children. I kept thinking we went to Chucky cheese. The whole restaurant is great and swank and then you have kids being obnoxious as we were trying to order. They run around climbing on the bar and pulling on the exhibits we were exploring. The SafeHouse seriously needs to cut them off at 7. They kept annoying the bartender to shows then more magic. That leads to my other complaint. There server/bartender was great! We just wish he had more time to show us magic. I guess he also was making drinks for the server's? Why waste the talent? We would have stayed longer and drank more if he didn't have to stop to make server drinks and babysit unattended children. The pricing is fair on the drinks however, every specialty drink has a sweet citrus to it. I would stay away from the specialty drinks and just stick to a martini. The drinks are great for southern California but not in a basement under a trader Joe's. Plus none of the drinks utilized fresh ingredients! They need more fresh fruit infused vodka or cucumber. Anything to liven this place up! One more issue, no ambiance music. I would love to hear swank bond music in the background or something that has lyrics. Everything was droned electronic trance music. Not good for conversations with friends. Who are you marketing to? Kids and broke ravers or 30 something's who wish to relax?","4/21/2017","5.0 star rating","Ij2Nr8RD_UYW7G5_iTuV6A","Alexandra N."

"Went last night as a few of my fellow agents and I were in town briefly after a successful mission in St.Louis. I have been to many a Safe House in my day, and I must say that The Curators at this amply size location have outdone themselves. Plenty of useful equipment both new and old surrounds the environment. And while the music was not suited to myself and my agents - the overall environment was top notch. Our server, whose agent name I can not recall immediately, did an excellent job. Food was delivered quickly and on-time. We were often not seated at our table and she would always alert us to the arrival of our order - excellent service. Xavier, our slight of hand bartender did great as well - we enjoyed his underspoken humor throughout his performance. Lastly, special mention goes to Agent Max Power. I have seen the best and worst in the spy world, and his greeting was second to none.If you havent been to the Chicago International Exports location, you are missing out. Plus, it will become your favorite place to bring your weary out of state cohorts. Just go. You won't regret it.","3/27/2017","5.0 star rating","W7_uYbDWZSzc8BwePBoixw","Stephen K."

"They have taken the Safehouse make them and mixed in much needed 21st century life into in. There are interactive done activity screens, temptation tests, a guy who interrogates you at the door to see if you're a worthy agent, a satellite, and even an escape tunnel that was really well designed. I won't ruin the secrets for you but instead will focus on the experience. I ordered the Provacatuer after our bartender recommended it. It was a hearty amount of ground beef with a bacon jam on top. I can only imagine how many calories, but hey it's spring break. I wish u could have mashed potatoes or taster tourse with the burger but the fries are OK. Or bartender Xavier was a blast! Not only did he makes us delicious spies demise, their version of the Mai tai, he is also a magician. And he's really amazing. He kept an audience of 15 mesmerized with las Vegas style magic! Then he gave us a small tour. This is why the SafeHouse stands out, they treat you like a guest in their home. This is definitely a fun addition to the Chicago experience!","3/20/2017","5.0 star rating","VblV7J8rtbqDtzPQoa45rQ","James S."
"Every time I have stepped foot in the SafeHouse I have been blown away at every turn. Fantastic food, delicious specialty cocktails, and exemplary service. Last night was my birthday, so I decided to stop into the SafeHouse for drinks with my sister, and we were taken care of very well. Agent Raja was our bartender, and he gave us the perfect mix of fast, friendly and fun service, talking to us like we were secret agents and mixing our drinks like a pro. They were delicious!Because it was my birthday, Agent Raja recommended the Fat Bastard desert. Giant mounds of ice cream, two huge brownies, and lots of whip cream. The desert lived up to its name; it was so huge my sister and I could not finish it with our other friend's help! And of course, very tasty. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish and I thoroughly recommend this place to anyone looking to have a fun night out and escape their boring life for an evening to become a secret agent relaxing while in Chicago on a mission. I will be back!","3/19/2017","5.0 star rating","EdOexP3FQxFRxEBnMnwuKw","Andy S."

"My friends and I had an AMAZING time at Safehouse. We had heard about the Milwaukee one and wanted to see if the new location lived up to the hype - we were not disappointed.We were met at the door by ""Agents"" Twist and Max Power -  They both were coy with us about how we got there and what we were doing. Max probed us with many hilarious questions while Twist sized us up.  We eventually had to prove our worth through a test that luckily we passed!  Our hosts then gave us entry permission and we got to see the Safehouse!The decor is phenomenal - a bunch of work was obviously put into the surroundings and it reminded me of MI6 headquarters.  There were gadgets and hidden cams everywhere!  We eventually sat down for our food and drink and I was equally as impressed.  The Rueben was to die for and the taste of the Mission Impossible burger was decadent.  There were so many other great sounding dishes on the menu - I can't wait to try more!Two tips as a new ""veteran"" spy:  Be on your toes when you go to the bathroom, and make sure you've stretched before you leave the restaraunt!!!","3/14/2017","5.0 star rating","fYBebCzBVJ_PKYcSqakULA","Dave G."

"A great ""Spy Themed"" restaurant that is sure to please! Armed with ""agent names"" and a willingness to open up and have fun, our party of 4 adults all enjoyed the ""James Bond"" atmosphere. It looked like the families with children were having a great time - and we could all see this as a good spot to bring out-of-town guests for a fun experience. Our ""agent"" waitress stayed in character, and brought us a game to play as we waited for our dinner. The cheese curds were tasty and everyone enjoyed their burgers. There was a lot going on, but it was still easy to hear each other and enjoy conversation.","2/21/2017","5.0 star rating","FMxmMM8jJ_I9OXKvCfj1WQ","Mary D."
