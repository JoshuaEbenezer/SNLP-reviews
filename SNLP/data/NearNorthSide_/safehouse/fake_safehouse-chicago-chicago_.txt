I thought it was a very unique and interactive restaurant. I enjoyed the drinks and ordered their steak along with a plate of nachos. I love how it's an underground spy themed location, especially when entering the restaurant and you have to either provide the secret password or have to do a small comical challenge. I noticed that one of the previous reviewers complained about not going to safehouse to play games, which is too bad because he should have either had a sense of humor or done his research on Safehouse. The young lady in the entrance did great with sticking to her character and got a good laugh out of my group and I.The hostess was very helpful and she remained patient with my group and I, despite a slight miscommunication on our behalf. The wait time wasn't too bad. Once we were seated, our waiter took our order and provided great service the rest of the time.My only complaint would be the wait time for food. My group and I waited about 40 minutes before being served our food. I do believe, however, the food was worth the wait.Overall, I enjoyed this place and will be coming back in the future. If you have a sense of humor and want an interactive experience that's more than your average restaurant/bar, I recommend Safehouse.", "user_name ": "Vick M.", "user_id": "SJl-gWG0zLiYH9aaM2SqUA", "review_date": "3/20/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating"}, {"review": "We had a great time at The \u00a0Safehouse.

This place is a diamond in the rough river north community. We stumbled upon their reviews and we had to try it. I think my girlfriend was invited to the soft opening as well.The pros: The d\u00e9cor is exquisite. It looks like a bomb shelter turned discotheque. The bartender or magician, was deep in bond character. I love his Fedora. Agent Xavier had my girlfriend and me chuckling at these camp tongue in cheek spy'linguistics. Plus he read our minds! And we're women not easy to do. He guessed the named of my first kiss and also guessed which drink I wanted. Way to go professor X, you madder our night. The White haired interrogator upstairs was amazing as well. We found out he wasn't even Australian! This man is hilarious once you find out it's all a put onThe multiple hats this crew wears is insane. I hope they're getting paid well. I think the staff is the BEST part of this brand.We tried a bacon onion burger and the cheese curds on Xavier's suggestion, he pushed them. So glad he did. They both were delicious! The cons: It's really hard to find. Maybe by design, to get the word of mouth on the streets? But have something a logo on the door or something. We arrived at 9 and wished there weren't children. I kept thinking we went to Chucky cheese. The whole restaurant is great and swank and then you have kids being obnoxious as we were trying to order. They run around climbing on the bar and pulling on the exhibits we were exploring. The SafeHouse seriously needs to cut them off at 7. They kept annoying the bartender to shows then more magic. That leads to my other complaint. There server/bartender was great! We just wish he had more time to show us magic. I guess he also was making drinks for the server's? Why waste the talent? We would have stayed longer and drank more if he didn't have to stop to make server drinks and babysit unattended children. The pricing is fair on the drinks however, every specialty drink has a sweet citrus to it. I would stay away from the specialty drinks and just stick to a martini. The drinks are great for southern California but not in a basement under a trader Joe's. Plus none of the drinks utilized fresh ingredients! They need more fresh fruit infused vodka or cucumber. Anything to liven this place up! One more issue, no ambiance music. I would love to hear swank bond music in the background or something that has lyrics. Everything was droned electronic trance music. Not good for conversations with friends. Who are you marketing to? Kids and broke ravers or 30 something's who wish to relax?", "user_name ": "Alexandra N.", "user_id": "Ij2Nr8RD_UYW7G5_iTuV6A", "review_date": "4/21/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating"}, {"review": "The Safehouse is something different in the city.

I have been to many a Safe House in my day, and I must say that The Curators at this amply size location have outdone themselves. Plenty of useful equipment both new and old surrounds the environment. And while the music was not suited to myself and my agents - the overall environment was top notch. Our server, whose agent name I can not recall immediately, did an excellent job. Food was delivered quickly and on-time. We were often not seated at our table and she would always alert us to the arrival of our order - excellent service. Xavier, our slight of hand bartender did great as well - we enjoyed his underspoken humor throughout his performance. Lastly, special mention goes to Agent Max Power. I have seen the best and worst in the spy world, and his greeting was second to none.If you havent been to the Chicago International Exports location, you are missing out.

I won't ruin the secrets for you but instead will focus on the experience. I ordered the Provacatuer after our bartender recommended it. It was a hearty amount of ground beef with a bacon jam on top. I can only imagine how many calories, but hey it's spring break. I wish u could have mashed potatoes or taster tourse with the burger but the fries are OK. Or bartender Xavier was a blast! Not only did he makes us delicious spies demise, their version of the Mai tai, he is also a magician. And he's really amazing. He kept an audience of 15 mesmerized with las Vegas style magic!
