"This bar held a Yelp event. Unfortunately I missed the Yelp event but got word from other Yelpers about how cool this place was so I grabbed a bunch of friends to check this place out with me.  First things first--there are no signs for Safehouse.  Look for the red door and the 60 E Ontario address right above the door. Next, give the lady the password. If you don't know it, do whatever she tells you to do to get access to the bar. Its a fun time and worth it for admission!I won't give you too many details because I don't want to spoil the fun, but there is a mission list if you choose to explore the bar. I highly recommend that you do.  Walking around will also help to uncover the password. My friends and I were able to find the password =)Service was definitely on point. Our only complaint was that we came for happy hour and ordered off the happy hour menu, but because we didn't tell our server that we wanted the happy hour portion and not the regular portion, we were automatically served and charged regular menu portion and prices.  What should have been a $6 happy hour nacho dish turned out to be a $17 regular nacho dish. On the plus side, our server was able to give us a 10% off for the misunderstanding and also allowed us to have separate checks to pay the bill.I was able to guess where the secret exit was and my friends and I had fun going through it. You can pay the $1 exit fee with cash or credit card. There's two sets of instructions on what to do so make sure to follow the instructions on the bigger sign to the left.This is definitely a unique experience. As a person who loves mystery and spy stuff, I really had a fun time here.  I'm looking forward to my next visit (hopefully next time using the password we found).","4/22/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=d67zTET_2IuVoWcUU0aWaQ","Janet E."
"I REALLY wanted to love this place! I read reviews about how amazing everyone was and how they stayed in character. For us, they did not. Okay, so when you first go in if you don't know the password you have to do something silly and they'll let you in. We had to hop around like bunnies. Then we had to also pay $5 each. We go inside and just stand at the hostess stand and have no idea what to do next. There were people just standing there and we were just awkwardly starting. I finally grabbed a menu and a girl finally turns and says she will seat us and the guy next to her says ""oh, I can help them! I'm just jumping around not doing anything"". Gee thanks. So he seats us. It takes forever for the waitress to come over and we can't even hear her. We order and they give you a little sheet of missions to do while waiting for your food. One of ours was to see the magic bartender. We go over to the bar and he breaks character and says ""I don't have time for that right now! I have too many drinks to make"". What the fuck. Ok, so we say forget it and go back to our seats. Food is very expensive. You can figure out the password by solving a clue. The other annoying thing is that if you want to leave and use the spy exit you have to pay $1. It's fun to go to once and experience it but never again.","4/23/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0Cv4DicgKO43Mz_WZGLOgA","Erika V."
"Omg!!!!!! This place was AMAZING!!!! I didn't even realize about the spy theme! The entrance is hidden so you need to look it up by the address. Then you walk into a fake office and either need to know the password and praise or need to do something silly to get in and prove you're not a double agent.We needed to do the conga line to get in. Then we walked down some stairs passed some fake heat sensors identifying us as non-double agents. Once inside,  everyone applauded us for getting in. Then we were seated.We then pick a secret agent name. Order your meal and can do a sort of scavenger hunt/mission while we waited for your meal. Food actually was not bad. The ambience was excellent. It was a lot of fun. Is a good place for groups and or kids. Highly recommend!","4/20/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fBULx2CoymGEKTgNixEjbQ","Jeanette F."
"I came here for an event and tried a sampling of their food and drinks. Here are the hits and misses:Hits:The Spy Theme! How fun! It's hard to describe, but if you come with an open mind, and have enough drinks in you, this place will be a blast! Take time to explore!! There are surprises hidden in every nook and crannies.Fried Cheese Curds. YUM! This is full of fried-goodness!Spy's Demise Cocktail: Sweet, refreshing, incredibly delicious, and super easy to drink, so be careful. It can knock you out before you know it!Cold War Cocktail: If you love sweets like I do, then this concoction of coffee, white chocolate and whip cream is for you! It's my favorite drink of the night and I somehow guzzled 2 glasses without realizing it. Misses:Those tacos are on the wrong side of blah.The Spy-See Cocktail:. I love spicy stuff so this jalapeno-infused drink caught my eye. I've had other spicy cocktails before and they were amazing, but in this one, the flavors didn't blend well together.  Disappointing.Steak Salad: the dressing was good, but the rest of the dish was just average.Bottom Line, would I come back? Absolutely! It was a blast walking around checking out the place. Plus, I need to try the rest of the food and cocktail menu.","4/12/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=te3wHLNIO2Wv8v2nM_hjvA","Pham D."
"Long has been the day since Chicago has seen a highly thematic and fully interactive restaurant that's a blast for adults and kids. Safehouse is the new beginning from the dusty tumble weeds of Ed Dabevicks & Planet Hollywood. Finally! I can thoroughly disclose a plethora of details about the multi facetted decor but it's better left unsaid. I can advise to try to complete the mission given upon arrival and to explore every nook and cranny in the Safehouse. Bathrooms are exceptionally entertaining and if you're lucky find the full time magician. He's spectacular. Having attended a Yelp event we were served burger, pulled pork, and chicken sliders. Loaded nachos, amazing cheese curds, ahi tuna salad with bites of ramen, and cesar salad. All delicious. Fun drinks included the Cold War, coffee based with whipped cream, Spy's Demise - rum based, Man with a Copper Cup - a Moscow Mule, and Agent Chi- a syringe full of cherry grenadine, to name a few. If you choose to take the secret alternate exit, we'll, let's just say I hope you have some flexibility! You'll leave wanting to bring your friends visiting from out of town and to celebrate a birthday. A really cool spot all around.","4/1/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6av0qSdZlDG6rapm3zH_sg","Michelle T."
"This place is AMAZING. First of all the spy theme - can it get cooler than that?! From the moment you walk in you are completely transported into the Safehouse Spy world. The interior is incredibly detailed with cameras, fun spy gadgets, screens, etc. You really do get a sense that you've stepped into a control center. The drinks or ""beverage briefing"" were so cute as well and fit in perfectly with the theme of the restaurant. The food was your normal restaurant food and it was delicious but I definitely think this is a must be place if not for the environment and experience alone. ‍","4/4/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UBcycBvac-YqLFtNNvRxkA","Chelsia L."
"I needed to check this place out since the concept is intriguing and I was bummed that I couldn't make it to the elite event. The day I wanted to go just happened to be the day after their official public grand opening. Thinking it would get quite busy on a Friday night, I made sure to come right after work to beat the crowd. It wasn't hard to find the place, just look for the red door. There were probably 10 people in line outside since everyone has to be ""processed"" before entering. Don't worry, the line moves quickly! This place is surprisingly large and can hold a lot of people. The decor is pretty interesting and there's a lot of things to look at and explore. Our waitress encouraged us to check the place out while we waited for our food and she offered to come find us when it was ready. She also gave us metal ring puzzles to solve and gave us 5 minutes to unlink them all. They brought us our entrees a couple minutes later and I quickly yelled out to my bf, ""Don't stop now! We've got 2 more minutes! We can do it!"" We were rewarded with stickers for our achievements and determination. I felt accomplished. :) Boy, this menu is full of long descriptions! The Fried C4 Cheese curds were very good, but a bit oily at the bottom of the dish. The bf had the Licensed to Kill Cheese Macaroni which I thought was pretty spicy. But I didn't hear any complaints from him. I had the Cuban Missile Crisis with fries. The sandwich was okay, the bread was a little too oily again. The menu description didn't mention any cheese on the sandwich, so I made sure to ask for swiss on mine (I'll be damned if I don't have cheese on my cubano!). The fries looked and tasted mediocre.There were a couple of drawbacks, in my opinion. I didn't realize this place was super family friendly. It takes away from the ambiance when there are kids running around and sliding on the booth seats looking for clues. After checking out SafeHouse's website when I got back home, I read that after 8pm it's 21 and over only. So if you are looking for an evening out sans kids, come after 8pm. Also, the menu items are pretty pricey. The mac and cheese was $18! But I guess that's just River North prices, for ya.Overall, this place was interesting. Don't forget to check out the fun photo booth. You can send the pics to yourself for free via email or text. And the secret exit is kind of neat. I probably won't be back since it felt like a tourist spot to me, but it's worth a visit.","4/3/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QKAR6h9wcx2M4xs9AJCUyQ","Shari B."
"In the mist of great 4/5 star reviews, there is just a small pool of those that did not have the same experience which includes me. I would give it more of a 3.5 rating if I could.I have visited this restaurant previously for a Yelp event and enjoyed myself very much enough to want to show my partner. We arrived to the interrogation room and provided the password so we were let in quickly. (I absolutely love the gentleman that was being the host there because he was in full character. Props to you and your wonderful mustache!)We entered and was told that there would be a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar instead. Greeted by the bartenders, they provided our name tags and menus for drinks and food. Wonderful! So far, lovely visit but this is when things weren't so great.Being at the bar, I would think that service would be above average only because well we were no more than two feet apart face to face. (We had three bartenders waiting us) He ordered a beer, Revolution Seasonal. We pretty much sat there for ten minutes or so before we were acknowledge about ordering food. We decided on cheese curds. When the cheese curds came out, the gentleman mention ""Oh, I'll come back to give you napkins."" He never came back... We were wiping our greasy fingers on the little napkins given when we ordered drinks. We finished the cheese curds which was taken away. No acknowledgement at all after that. They didn't ask if we wanted to order anything else. I actually had to that awkward half raised up hand like I was in elementary school to wave down the bartender to order our burgers. To remind you, we are sitting at the bar. My partner wanted to see what the 'code beer' they provided. So, he lean forward and tried to ask him about the beer but the bartender just walked by him not noticing. I don't know if he had an off day or something. At this point, my partner glass was half full and said to me ""I'll just finish this beer then they will ask me if I want another."" That was what happened. Our burgers finally came out on these wood platters and they were absolutely delicious. We finished our meals which were taken away. At this point, we had empty glasses. No refills at all. No action was taken here so we asked for the check and while they were taking care of that, our waters were finally refilled. Cheese curds and MOAB was flavorful and dielicious.I would say they were must have's when visiting this placeI REALLY want to love this place. I do. The service just wasn't great for me. I felt ignored. I had to wave the bartender to order food. I never got napkins with my appetizer. Water was filled till we asked for the check. I can tell the bartenders were 'burnt out' from the spy themePossibly service is better when sitting at an actually table? That would be my suggestion.","4/2/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VAaihmzd_xPf4-GFzfxZ-Q","Kim N."
"I came here for a Yelp event and I am so glad that I did.  The staff was so nice and attentive which was great.  They actually made us all feel comfortable in the space and I loved there undercover names which made me laugh and smile. The food was so good that I didnt think about taking a picture until my food was gone...dang it lol! I say if you get a chance to go to the SAFEHOUSE dont pass it up because it is a great adventure in food and fun.  Im going to go back with some friends and family to enjoy the experience again. The only issue that I had was my phone didnt work even with there password and I cant tell you what it is because I wouldn't be a good agent if I did...smile!!! I think it was my carrier because it didn't seem others had the same problem.

"This is a really fun venue, definitely the best over-the-top themed restaurant I've been to. There's lots to explore, including how to get in and how to get out. To avoid spoliers I'll just say that the entrance is indeed the door at 60 E Ontario, and let you discover the rest for yourselves.The food here is surprisingly good. We started with some pretzels, which I probably wouldn't order again, since they weren't cooked enough for my taste, but we liked everything else.The grilled cheese sandwich was nicely browned and very generously stuffed, the spy burger was good, the fries were thin and crispy, and the ahi tuna salad was a good lighter choice, particularly if you like pea pods, as it was full of them.Service was friendly, and the servers do a good job of staying in character without being overly serious about it.Highly recommended for families or a fun night out. It was pleasantly navigable on a rainy Sunday afternoon. That's important, because you're going to want to explore the whole place. On the other hand, there might be magic at the bar at night...","3/26/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA","Steve A."
"Do you ever wonder where James Bond went for a bite to eat?Oh sure, there were the glamorous casinos, beautiful cocktail bars, feasts at palatial palaces and even on the moon, but the man had to just want a burger from time to time. And if you're the world's greatest spy, you can't just walk into a Wendy's, right? You need a spy meal for a spy lifestyle.If he was in Chicago, I imagine he'd come to SafeHouse.Now, this is actually the second Safehouse. The first is an epic and well-loved establishment in Milwaukee, which has been open since 1966! But this newest, latest Chicago edition? It is awesome. If you ever wanted to pretend to be a spy, even for a meal, this is where you need to go. It's fun, it's kitschy, it's an excellent night out.THE ATMOSPHEREIt's hard to describe SafeHouse without ruining the surprises and fun inside, so only LIGHT SPOILERS from here on out. It won't give you the full experience, but (if you choose to accept it), you'll at least get a sense of what your mission will entaYou walk into the International Exports and find... a man at a desk. No bar, no staff, just a basic office. And he greets you warmly and wants to know what he can do for you.I'm not going to ruin the fun of the entrance from here, but you have to sweet talk your way into the secret entrance, which leads you down into the hideout.I LOVE this bar. I love the Dr. Strangelove-esq map above one bar and the gadgets and gizmos above the other. I love that it switches from 70's bachelor pad to underground submarine bunker just by turning the corner. I love there are lights flashing, sirens ringing and so many buttons to press.There's also a piece of the Berlin Wall on the wall, because of course there is.I even love the weird sense of humor this spot has, like the buttons on the panels, the ladie's shoes underneath a glass stall in the men's restroom or the battle cat on the shelf.THE SPY HUNTWhen you arrive, you're given a list of missions to accomplish around the restaurant. It's a spy-filled scavenger hunt!Now it was... OK. There's actually so much to see, touch and experience here, you do need something like this to point you in the right direction and make sure you don't miss anything. But what could have been a fantastic portion of the SafeHouse experience was lacking.Currently, many of these clues are either vague or misleading. For instance, the first one tells you to crawl into a hole, but it's actually a space in a wall 15 feet up that doesn't actually contain anything (and apparently, people are still trying to climb the shelves and crawl in there and staff have to stop them.)However, we were told that they're still revamping it and it will evolve over time. I'm sure when they figure it out and polish it up, it will be a mission worth taking.THE FOOD + DRINKSAh, what you actually came for.The food here is your classic mix of American eats: burgers, sandwiches, steaks, etc., all with rather amusing spy names.I got the Sr-71 Blackbird, which was a chicken sandwich that was bigger than my head!It was indeed damn delicious chicken, perfectly fried, although it was light on the sauce in the middle, especially for such a giant piece of chicken and probably could have used a little extra lettuce and tomatoes. Still, every bite was devoured, which was not easy because it really was a giant undertaking onto itself. I also upgraded from fries to onion rings, and dammit, they were perfectly fried with whole onions inside and so very good.We also got the Fried C4 Cheese Curds. Get the damn cheese curds! There's also a pretty delicious drink menu, because what's a great spy without a great drink in hand?Around the table, we tried The Spy-See, a tequila cocktail kicked up a notch with heat, the previously mentioned Sterling Archer, which was, ""A cocky concoction featuring Ketel One Vodka"", the Spy's Demise, a too-easy to drink take on the Long Island ice tea and The Cold War, a really, really, really sweet after-dinner drink Stoli Raspberry Vodka, espresso and white chocolate.We ended with the London is Falling bread pudding, which was sweet, hot and served in a tiny adorable frying pan. Although I will say, if we were going to come back, we would have done the Fat Bastard, which was a gigantic ice cream sundae complete with an epic sparkler. We saw it done for someone's birthday and it was a sight to be seen.OVERALLReady for a slew of Bond puns? Because they're firing right at you right now:This is for your eyes only. Those who have been to the Milwaukee branch and aren't sure about this new one, never say never again. You'll be over the moonraker when you accept your mission here. The space is at the goldfinger standard of fun, kitchy bars and it's hard to say Dr. No to anything on the menu. Yes, the world is not enough, but SafeHouse certainly is for certainly is for a fantastic night out.After all, you only live twice. Make the most of it, agent.","3/20/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aKN3Fq2uaRJTwZRPlI5GcQ","Alex S."
"What a great time! Came here spur of the moment with some girlfriends and had a blast.One of my friends had the password, leaving the rest of us to navigate our way through the process. The drinks here are delicious and reasonably priced for Chicago. The food was also decent and it's great that you get dinner and entertainment for a fun night. The cheese curds were a bit salty for my taste, but the fries were so good. We saw other tables with elaborate desserts that looked amazing.We completed the list of tasks and had a great time. Don't want to say too much cause it may give away some of the intriguing parts. My friend said this location is much better than the Milwaukee original.","3/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AK8q2vlPo2WvR-6WUEc2Sg","Karen B."
"Somebody cue ""Secret Agent Man"".... SafeHouse Chicago! One of my favorite spots in Milwaukee now in Chicago! So where to begin here... It's a safe house for spies. Call me Secret Agent Fran... Entrance is unmarked. Come on people, it a safe house for crying out loud. It's not really a safe house if everyone knows it a safe house. I'll give you a clue, use the address and look for 'International Exports Co'. Once you enter, we were greeted by a gentlemen with a thick Russian accent. I tried to slip what I had recalled was the password from a previous visit to the Milwaukee SafeHouse, however apparently it wasn't it. Had to perform a series of tests to prove worthiness. Once you gain admittance, a secret door lets opens to let you down a stairway where you and scanned for further ID verification. Pretty cool. Upon entering, cheers and clapping from the bar by other agents for a nice warm welcome as you realize you were being watched during your test. ""I thought this was a favorite spot Agent Fran, why the mediocre rating?"" Well, once we gained passage and got seated, we waited and waited and waited for our waiter to come. Maybe that's why they're called WAITers & WAITresses. Easily over 15 minutes waiting for someone to come to tend to us. In addition, water glasses were dirty and the bus boy gave me a little extra attitude when I had kindly asked for a new glass pointing out the lipstick around the rim of the glass. Also, to take the secret phone booth exit out of the safehouse like a true spy, it costs a $1. I thought it was a joke and ended up stuck in the phone booth for a minute. Good thing it takes credit card? That was kind of annoying and couldn't help but think 'tourist trap' in real life.Other than all those things that annoyed me, still a really cool and one of a kind bar. Surprisingly the food was amazing. I went with the MOAB aka Mother of All Bombs... err Burgers. Double patty, soft bun, egg, bacon, secret sauce... I couldn't help but think they sent spies to Au Cheval to do some recon. Yeah it was that good.There's a series of missions to accomplish if you choose to accept. I would definitely suggest at least strolling around to look around. Lots of hands on and interactive missions to perform and accomplish. Even some cool memorabilia and a chunk of the Berlin Wall!Anyways, this one easily could've been a 5 star rating. Poor table service and having to pay to exit just really irked me. I know it's only a dollar, but still after that service coughing up another dollar was the last thing I wanted to do. Anyways, 'til next time.74/365","3/15/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lZx_XOuL5wACxaNtby4JEA","Francis R."
"I will focus on the food because I don't want to spoil all the surprises in store for you during your visit but this place offers a surprising interactive dining experience. The side entrance is thru a hotel and can be hard to find but I guess for a top secret location, it's all part of the experience. Ok, now the best part the food. Was expecting typical bar  food but surprisingly was surprised and the different twists they had on each traditional gastropub food item. For an appetizer to split amongst several people, I recommend the cheese fries layered on top with cheese curbs. Topped with a mushroom gravy  and a fried egg, these were probably one of the most amazing fries I have ever eaten. I'm the worlds most indecisive person, so I split everything with my partner in half to get to try two things. The chicken sandwich was done nicely with bacon strips and served with your choice of tater totes, Cole slaw, or fries. I ended up with the golden nugget cheese sandwich. Stacked thick and oozing with cheeses , it's actually how it should be made. Very pleased and the interactive experience was a nice surprise to the evening.","3/17/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UL4gAHMbbmTg2_qKGvbNaA","Antonio M."
"The ""Russian"" who let us into the interrogation room was in character the whole time and made the beginning experience a lot of fun. The spy-themed decoration was on point, and even though it was a little awkward at first, it was really fun to loosen up and do silly things with a bunch of strangers. Once we gained access downstairs we were surprised by how big the space was! We settled at the bar in the front and were served by Agent Neptune. He was so attentive and friendly, and we had exceptional service at the bar. He passed us waters even when we didn't ask for them, and made a point to give us new silverware/napkins between food orders. Between the two of us, we ordered 3 drinks, onion rings, mac & cheese and poutine. We spent a little over $100. The drinks weren't the greatest-- but we ordered a bloody mary, an old fashioned... and one off the spy menu... Maybe the other ""spy"" drinks are better? The onion rings weren't anything special either, except that they came stacked on a wire airplane. The mac and cheese was very good, the chicken, broccoli and bacon added great flavor and texture to the macaroni. It was a tiny bit spicy, and I liked the kick to it. The poutine though... it literally took an hour to come out, and by the time it came out, we didn't really want to eat it anymore. More than an hour after waiting at the bar, I asked the hostess how much longer we would have to wait before getting a table-- I said this all non-accusingly! But she responded very rudely, saying we were put as no-shows since they texted us 3 times and we never responded. Turns out they put down the wrong name and phone # so they had been texting the wrong #. But they were still very short with me, saying they would seat us. I went back to the bar and the Poutine had finally come out by that time, so we just decided to finish it quickly and the bar and leave. I went back to tell the hostess we didn't need to be seated, and that they could give it to someone else. And she gave me the biggest fake smile/""ok thanks."" TLDR: Food and drinks are okay.

"Gave this place another shot and so glad I did.Shoutouts to agents Wonderful and TFunk for making this experience entirely different from my last. Honestly, request TFunk if you come here. Refreshing, unpretentious and attentive- all you could want in a server.This time around, we tried the poutine to start. Holy cheese curds! Fun fact: it's vegetarian. Mushroom gravy, and the perfect amount of cheesecurds shockingly without being heavy. So bomb.I asked Agent Wonderful what his favorite dish on the menu was- burger provocateur. Ordered it and they sure nailed it. Bacon jam. Need I say more?As it was a Friday during lent, my catholic dining partner opted for the fish tacos. Plot twist- they come with fries. My goodness. The aioli with the perfect amount of spice.Now- Im not someone who likes dessert, but when the agents insisted on the fat bastard...who was I to say no?

"The Safehouse in Milwaukee has been attracting Special Agents on the run for years, but I will focus this review on the Chicago branch of this clandestine organization known only as #Control.Once locating the unmarked entrance (Hint: there is a gas lit flame ensconced by the door), you ingress to a well appointed room manned by an eccentric operative of #Control. He is pleasant, but on guard, and wastes little time before asking you to whisper in his ear, the highly restricted #Password. Knowing the passphrase, as I did, allows immediate access to the lower levels of the structure, through a cleverly concealed #falsewall. Not having access to the appropriate passphrase will cost you time and a small amount of dignity, as you are made to perform simplistic acts of silliness to amuse the weary agent guarding the hidden entrance.Robotic voices confirm that you are passing through bodily scanners as you descend the bunker-like concrete steps to the entrance of the venue. As I passed through the entryway, I was greeted by applause from the patrons, all of whom are watching new entrants upstairs on a concealed closed circuit television. I believe my ovation was due to the fact that I knew the password and was allowed quick access to the underground layer... but it really could have been how good I looked in the tux I had worn from Lyric Opera's stellar presentation of Eugene Onegin earlier that evening. I really don't know. Upon settling into the bar, and acknowledging the compliments of my authentic wardrobe, I ordered a martini (stirred not shaken - sorry, Bond fans) and took in a full view of the place. The decor ranges from super ""techie"" modern to cold war era memorabilia. The constant theme being spy technology and well known historical figures of fact and mostly of fiction. There are authentic pieces from James Bond's Aston Martin, reconstituted control panels of Russian missile silos, and the famed illuminated Mercator map of the Western Hemisphere, where various locations have been red flagged by #Control. The drink list was solid, but then, I'm a martini man and had plenty of options. My date ordered a well balanced libation named for the femme fatale Vesper Lynd, a character in the Ian Fleming novel and 2006 cinematic adaptation, Casino Royale. Interesting fact for #Control: While the Vesper Lynd on your #clandestine menu is not a martini at all, the Vesper Martini was originally conceived by Fleming and became popular in the wake of the 1953 release of the Bond novel Casino Royal. The making of this concoction is what gave rise to the immortal words spoken by the ineffable spy ""shaken, not stirred.""This space will clearly benefit from more bodies than you will find hanging out at midnight on a Wednesday as I did. There is a dance floor (ample, though not huge) and quite a few tables that wind their way around corners and walls adorned with spy memorabilia and artifacts. Screens throughout the venue give real-time video on several sensitive installations. I've mentioned the feed from the ""front-room"" where the operative controls access to #Safehouse. There is also an externally mounted camera that I used to keep tabs on my spy car outside. Lastly, there's a feed from the Milwaukee, where #MsMoneyPenny stands vigilant against enemy operatives infiltrating the alternate secure location.Exfiltrating the venue is a fun experience unto itself. There is a phone booth in the back that can be made to reveal a secret exitway. This trick, however, costs a dollar (cash or credit accepted... of course...). Not only am I not a fan of spending money to leave, we couldn't actually exit because the door to the secret passage was was stuck. The #operative had to give it a swift kick. That said, there are impressive displays as you exit this way, and the passage leads to an ordinary hotel lobby that is not where you entered. That was pretty cool #Control. I look forward to returning with my clandestined cohorts late on a Saturday night to experience the full effect of #Controll's latest underground installment.

"I had never been to the Milwaukee location, but I was instantly intrigued when I read the whole concept. I went with 3 other people during lunch time and all of us are in our 30's. With that said I think the place is suited for a younger crowd.Upon arrival it was funny when we didn't know the password so they made us do a hoola dance. Once inside our waiter was really nice, but it was so loud that I didn't really hear him when he was going over the game card thing.While we waited on our appetizer we were able to cross one item off the list. Once the food came though we didn't revisit the list again. lol. We just ate and talked. Now 5 stars for the food. I wasn't expecting the food to be as good as it was. Nachos were excellent! For my entree I went with the mission accomplish Burger and another winner. We finished lunch with bread pudding. Yum! When we left we we're reminded where we were cause we had a hard time getting out and one of the ""Agents"" had to clear us. I think if the place looked more realistic I would have gotten into character more, but how it's set up I would recommend for younger crowd. Make sure to go though cause the food is delicious! :)","3/6/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_vbEQU_xD95RZ-7j93z9hA","Tavi J."
"We went to EscapeHouse on a groupon and due to a scheduling mix up, they gave us a $50 gift card to use here. It was so much fun getting into the place! I'll leave out details so you can enjoy it yourself :)Once inside though, Agent Sparrow took awesome care of us. We put in our order and then explored based on the list they gave us. They weren't clues and such like an escape room, it was more of find this cool part of the restaurant - now find this one. Once we got back to the table, Agent Sparrow gave us a table mission and we finished it in time so we got coupon for the next time we go back :) Now for the foooood. I got the poutine fries and I was really looking forward to the fried egg on top but it was over cooked so it wasn't the runny mess I was expecting. If ordering this, I'd ask the server to make sure that it's cooked to your preference, whatever that may be. Friends got the spy burger, wan lei salad, and the grilled cheese. They each liked their dish! Overall, the service is great, the concept is awesome, and the food is pretty good. That warrants 5 stars in my book :)","3/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1nQgh9EsgAF-KpJ-hxIkfQ","Heena D."
"Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to get to SafeHouse Chicago. ASAP. I have a feeling this is going to become one of the hot new bars in Chicago and I'm really happy I got to go before it starts getting really crowded. The first challenge is to find the bar, since the entrance is unmarked. To find it, keep an eye out for a red door. If you don't know the password to get in, be prepared to take part in a top-secret clearance test to make sure you're not a double agent. Just remember, someone is always watching...Once inside, you encounter an entire spy-themed restaurant/bar. Create your Agent name and you can complete with missions to complete that require you to get out of your seat and explore the incredibly interactive space. If you're sitting down for dinner, you may even have the chance to complete some secret table missions. I didn't realize they actually served food so, unfortunately, my group had already eaten and we regretted it as soon as we flipped through the surprisingly extensive menu. Even though we were full, we still ordered some of the cheese curds because they sounded amazing--and they were. The perfect amount of fried goodness.  Our drinks were good--I had the Espionage and it was deliciously sweet. They even brew their own beer in a collab with Motor Row! This definitely isn't a bar for introverts and, if getting into the theme isn't your thing, then you're going to have a rough time. I strongly suggest making sure you have a couple of hours to eat and explore everything. We didn't know there was so much to do and only allotted 45 minutes before our movie. We didn't have much time to complete any challenges and I'll be planning a return trip soon to complete the full mission!","3/4/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8ul5jONkVI95S367DSj-Vw","Sara G."
"Went on Friday night which was the 2nd day after their grand opening.  It was a little difficult to find the correct entrance, so keep an eye out for the red door.  Luckily my friends are staying at The James Hotel so we just had to walk across the street to get there. You might have to wait in line because it takes a little bit of time for people to go through the ""interrogation process"". I won't say too much about that because you will have to experience that for yourself!!They were not serving food at that time, so next time when I get to try the food I'll update my review.Make sure to explore the place and try out all the best gadgets and puzzles. We wanted to try the photo potholes too but they said it was currently down.Definitely a very fun spy experience!

"Ok I don't want to spoil any surprises but once you find this place and it's little tricky to find what an awesome experience that's all I'll say about that. Once you're inside the whole vibe is a underground secret ops location. They give you a sheet of paper for scavenger hunt that you can do while you wait for your food. I ordered chicken sandwich with bacon, tomato and side of coleslaw. The chicken sandwich and coleslaw was both very good. I forgot the appetizer we got but it was fries wish mushrooms and cheese curds and egg on top. It was AMAZING especially when you let the yolk from the egg leak on to the fries. Highly recommend trying that. The bar area was also cool place. Had magician  there. Exiting from this place also has a neat little surprise for you. Overall I've never experienced anything like this type of bar/restaurant very cool unique and fun place to go. Definitely recommend giving this place a try trust me you won't be disappointed!","3/17/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=n0YUqMs6zCWpQ9TjIskOjg","Jesse M."
"Spy-themed kitsch at its best! This family-friendly honey trap below Ontario Street is worth the brush pass, especially for its stellar appetizers and stealthy entrees. But the higher-than-average Chicago price points might leave some double agents feeling burned.Upon entering the covert facility through its subtle red door at #60 E. Ontario - simply labeled ""International Exports Limited""- you step into what looks like an office waiting room where you are immediately greeted by a Miss Moneypenny-like receptionist, complete with a thick Russian accent. I won't spoil the fun - just remember to have your password ready, and that ""Control Is Watching"". After passing the ""double agent test"", you weave your way downstairs through the winding staircase, eventually popping out at the Control Booth (hostess stand), where you're greeted with a loud ""Welcome Agents!"" scream that might scare ""The Living Daylights"" out of you - but not to worry, you'll eventually get used to hearing the ""Welcome To Moe's""-like greeting every few minutes.Unlike their Milwaukee site, the Chicago craft cocktail menu leans towards sweet bourbon drinks, with their ""covert concoctions"" a full $2 and $3 more than the same drinks served back in Wisconsin. The Agent Chi ($14) is a super-sweet blend of Koval Bourbon and lemon lime soda with a syringe of raspberry Frambois you're suppose to shoot into the small, eight-ounce glass. The Sterling Archer is a perfect blend of vodka, pear schnapps, lemon juice and Jamaican Bitters, but, again, woefully overpriced at $14. Ditto for the copper-mugged Moscow Mule made with chintzy Tito's Vodka, ginger puree and fizzy soda.While there are no hunky henchmen and scantily clad Bond girls wandering around to distract diners from the constantly flashing and beeping interior, the food offerings caught everyone's attention at our table. We started with the C-4 Cheese Curds ($10), perfectly browned Wisconsin mild white cheddar nuggets, hand dipped and fried to order. The Blacklisted Chicken Tenders ($14), which were highly recommended by our waitress/bartender tag team, are also a secret standout - sautéed tenders with a stealthy, sneak-up-and-garrote-your-throat heat, cooled by a classic New Orleans-style remoulade dipping sauce.On to the entrees, the Day Smart Turned Chicken ($12) is a marinated chicken breast with smoky bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce and sliced 'mater on a perfectly warmed bun. The SR-71 Black Bird chicken sandwich ($15) was the high-flying hit of the evening - undoubtedly the juiciest ""Goldeneye""-fried chicken breast I've put my ""Jaws"" around since leaving North Carolina - and that includes the sandwich and biscuit offerings from Do-Rite Donuts, and The Roost. The Cuban Missile Crisis ($15) was billed as a smoked pork sandwich, a'la a classic Cuban, but it lacked a healthy crust on the mildly panini-pressed exterior. The Tradecraft Fish Tacos looked pretty decent as well - three fried cod strips topped with coleslaw and chipotle ranch dressings, but XOCO-pricey at $16.Sadly, the side dishes were as disappointing as some past Bond villains - the limp and soggy French fries were as pale as Zoa from ""Die Another Day"", and the small shooter of sweet coleslaw was as under-portioned as Nick Nack from ""The Man With The Golden Gun"". Splurge on the $1 up charge for the onion rings, 'cause ""You Only Live Twice""!Departing the underground facilities can be a challenge itself - just remember to have a spare, crisp $1 bill handy if you opt to exit through the stainless steel bank vault door. I mistakenly swiped my credit card in the phone booth to pay my one-dollar exit fee, only to have my bank shut down my account. (Gee, thanks!) Overall, a great dining experience for families and those gaggles of tourists in town for the weekday convention - the food was certainly better than average and the service was absolutely top notch. Unfortunately, the price points will keep the local neighbors like us away - but, to quote the Bond film knock-off, ""Never Say Never"".","3/12/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vz4eJpx3VpIoqC0VobaRDA","Jamie M."

"Safehouse is a really cool and different place to go to in Chicago! I would definitely take someone who's out of the state here just because it's not your typical restaurant.   My friends and I got here around 7pm on a Saturday and there was an hour and 15 minute wait! However we were able to grab a booth by the hour to drink and eat, it's just away from the main seating area though. It was crazy busy and so loud, we had to shout to talk to each other but we didn't mind that.   I got the tradecraft tacos, which were really good! I wish they had different choices instead of only fish though. The sauce they use was yummy, and they're a good size so you'll be full afterwards.   The problem we had were with the drinks and service. I got the spy see, and I enjoyed the name of the drink but not the drink itself. It basically tasted like water and it was not remotely spicy. My friend got the spy's demise, which she said was more or less pineapple juice. It took forever to get the bill, so just beware of that when it's busy!","4/9/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PHbTQM0IG_VSIGpUwDMzXA","Jamie J."
"I was just here last night with some friends.They have got this spy theme down pat.It's rather unique from Chicago.It's like ""get smart"" came back not as a TV show but as a restaurant/bar/club lounge.The food I had and my friends had was outstanding. We had some cheese curds which oozed with deliciousness.Then I had their version of fish and chips which is good and presents itself as a hearty meal.One of my friends ordered the salmon entree. She allowed me to taste it. I recommend it. It was very tasty, it contained the right amount of bbq sauce.  I have cooked salmon many times and I prefer to be medium or medium rare but im always off on the timing. But the chef who made this was right on the money. I highly reccomend that and the nachos. .Dessert as opposed to desert/ Those are 2 different things. The dessert was awesome. We had the brownie cheesecake. it had chocolate sauce on the side.

"Overall: cool/unique place for a family or tourist looking for a different experience in Chicago.Came here for a Yelp event and initially loved the concept - secret bar, unmarked, spy-themed - I thought there was no way I couldn't love this place. Unfortunately, it fell a little flat for me on the atmosphere. Seemed a bit more novelty and (for lack of better terms) gimmicky for a spy-themed restaurant/bar.I will say though, the food was great and I really appreciated the theatrics when entering as well as the servers/bartenders staying in 'character' addressing guests as spies and agents. If I were a kid, this place would be heaven.The back bar has a very strange set up, it's really small in the center where the serving area is but the outer parts extend for inside and outside seating which kind of cuts off the flow of service for the bartenders.","3/30/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RmZftN5LBMlobgKISfoVjw","Ryanne A."
"A few things to note:1) Know what to expect - that this is a themed restaurant. The first time I came with my boyfriend, looking for a quick meal on our way home after a day of work. SafeHouse had good reviews online due to being new and was nearby - so we stopped here. Little did we know that our ""quick dinner"" was actually a spy-themed restaurant. We opened the door and were greeted by a gruff-sounding man in character, but we thought we'd accidentally walked into someone's office and felt bad. Once I realized what was going on, I played along - but my boyfriend was not amused. I came again tonight and there was a teenager in the group I was ushered in with who was also not amused and refused to play along with the gimmick. So like I said, know what to expect. 2) Food is okay - pretty good but nothing to write home about. I feel like you would go to this restaurant more for the spy experience if you're into that kind of thing. It's not cheap (although it's in a touristy area, so that's not surprising) - pretty standard American food (burgers, salads, mac n cheese, etc) but with a spy theme. 3) As some other reviewers have mentioned, you had to pay $1 to leave. I honestly wasn't sure if it was a gimmick or not because I find the concept of having to pay to leave so ridiculous, whether or not it's a ""cool"" route. But I just wanted to get out of there and get home - so I swiped. Lo and behold, the phone did NOT ring (as it supposedly would if I swiped my credit card). I stood there debating whether I was supposed to swipe/pay again before someone else came and told me there was another more normal exit. I'm super annoyed that I was forced to pay to try to leave via a way that didn't even work, and that alone makes me take a star off from 3 stars to 2. It's left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended, being on Yelp) and turns me off to coming back, to be honest.","3/28/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z6UZvxZDgDsFn-f54QDzpQ","Susan L."
"I LOVED this place.  It was so cool.  Easily the best theme restaurant I've ever been to.....and this is coming from someone who has been to Casa Bonita many, many times since childhood.  For those people who have complained about the theme, saying ""I didn't expect this, was just looking for a quick dinner/drink""......are you freaking kidding me?  This isn't the kind of place you wander into thinking ""oh, this must be a restaurant!""  This is the kind of place you go for an experience, and if you know about it, either you KNOW that it is a themed restaurant/bar or you just didn't bother to read any information WHATSOEVER about the place.  It is on their website, it is on yelp, it is on google.  It's pretty clear what you're getting into.  Anyways, I came here for a yelp event and was extremely excited to check the place out.  They provided nachos, sliders, cheese curds, and drinks.  I don't remember the *clandestine* names they called the drinks, but one was rum based with a pineapple wedge that was DELICIOUS, another was a gin martini.  I wasn't a fan of the gin martini, but that's mostly because I don't particularly like gin.  As for the food, other than the cheese curds, which were passed around by waiters, it was buffet style and average.  However, that is to be expected at a large event.  The cheese curds were phenomenal- I would go back just for those!My fellow agents and I had a really fun time exploring the place, mostly trying to find the password for next time (it is hidden somewhere in the restaurant).  There are a ton of things to explore, but I would not recommend coming when there are a lot of people eating dinner.  It can get a little awkward trying to look at things in the ""spybrary"" when a family of four is just trying to eat dinner.  Service was great, and even though a party of 100 people is probably annoying to serve, they were all gracious and friendly! Overall, this is a great experience and I'm looking forward to coming back to eat off of their full menu and discover some things I probably missed.","3/29/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pEaDXFHgsbJNLLnrzyDWSQ","Ali F."

Without giving too much away, because I don't want to ruin it for noobs but you'll do some crazy shit throughout the night. Honestly, I was drinking too much to engage with the missions, maybe I'll try that out next time when I'm more sober because those are on the very detailed side of town. I just put on my agent badge and started messing with stuff. There's a lot to tinker with if you're into tinkering. LIGHT SPOILER I didn't expect to get a workout at the club! I think the last time I've done anything remotely close to what I did that night when it was time to leave... was when I was 5 years old at a jungle gym! This place is FUN.

They let you walk around and there's different things in the restaurant that you can check out.I got the Fried Chicken Sandwich which was really good, but the fruit is not worth the extra $2. The onion rings are worth the extra $1 though!

"-----****----- CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BELOW ----****-----SafeHouse is awesomeYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to walk in and be greeted by a stern receptionist. Don't know the password? Perform a silly task to prove your worthiness to mission control (in my group's case, a conga line). We were granted access, walked downstairs, and were greeted with applause by people who had been watching us on the cameras downstairs.The rest of the night was spent nibbling on surprisingly delicious food, sipping on well-made, fun cocktails, and exploring the space in an attempt to solve all the 'missions' they gave us. This involved finding random, fun spots around SafeHouse and was a ton of fun. Everyone there was really great at sticking to the theme - calling us agents, asking to 'disarm us' (aka clear our drinks), and pretty much every spy lingo you could think of. It was seriously such a fun night - my favorite was the magician at the bar, who I spent about 30 minutes in awe of asking him to perform every trick he knew...I have never been to the Milwaukee location, but I had so much fun here.

The bartenders call you by your spy name when you order a drink.

I can't reveal too much, but if you are looking for a great time come here and ask for Diva Davine. She has the proper instructions for you ;) I must say it's a bit pricey tho.

"The 2 stars are for the awesome bartenders and the manager.  This was a very disappointing experience for me.  I've been to the Milwaukee location and was so excited that there was another one close to home.This is a tough review to write because the manager did end up comping our whole group's meal due to our terrible service with the hostesses.  We had a group of 15 (2 ended up leaving after an hour because we waited so long and they had to leave for another event).  The first group of people who got there told the hostess we had 15 people.  She told them that it would be about a 2 hour wait.  So my friend suggested splitting the group up into 2 or 3 tables.  The hostess said it would still be an hour to an hour an a half wait.  There were a bunch of open tables so we didn't understand why it would be such a long wait.  The entire time, the hostess had RBF and was just being nasty in her tone to us.  There was one big table that would have seated us that we saw open for an hour while we waited so we asked the hostess once again why couldn't we be seated there.  She told us it was for a reservation.  On their website it states that they do not take reservations.  After talking to one of the bartenders we found out you can call ahead and tell them to save some tables for you.  We were really annoyed with the way that the hostess was not trying to accomodate the group. My friend ended up going to find a manager to see what he could do. The manager said he'd see what he could do. So we wait another 15-20 minutes (by now we've been waiting for 1.5 hrs) and wonder what is the status of our table.  I go up to the hostess and she tells me that the manager didn't tell her anything and that we never told her what we wanted to do.  I told her the manager told us he'd try to get us seated so she finally goes to talk to her manager.  He comes to talk to us and apologizes for the wait and ends up buying the whole group a round of drinks.  My sister ends up going to the manager later and telling him how rude and not helpful his hostesses were as well as how they laughed (in a bitchy way) at her at one point when she was asking (for the millionth time) about getting a table.  When we finally did get seated, the manager apologized once again and told us our whole groups' meal would be comped.  I appreciated that a lot but it didn't make up for dealing with those hostesses' attitudes.While we were waiting for our table, we got drinks at the bars (there are two) and the bartenders were all so nice and friendly. One of them was actually the one to suggest to us to talk to the manager after we explained to him how we were waiting for so long for a table.As for the food, the cheese curds were amazing. We had onion rings and poutine too which were good.  I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich which was tender but lacked flavor.  The whole spy theme was pretty disappointing compared to the Milwaukee location.  There weren't really many ""missions"" to solve.  It was more like, find this or that rather than solving puzzles. I would rather drive to Milwaukee than come back to this location even after getting the meal comped.  The whole experience was a let down.","3/20/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eFDjBULmcp7JixZJLVV9Cg","Kat A."
"This place was not fun. Waiting in line at 9 pm wasn't so bad for a new place in River North, but it was the start of the annoyance. It's​ a theme bar (negative), so it you don't get the password before hand you are shuffled in with a small group and asked to act like an idiot for 10 minutes. The 50s and 60s Cold War espionage theme wears thin immediately as you wait at the bar for some particularly slow pouring of a  spy themed drink or an $8  Budlight. The decor is like if TGI Friday's and Rain Forest Cafe had a love child that only watched the Timothy Dalton ""James Bond"" Movies.You will not be able to find the restroom until it's almost too late.

Once we got into the bar itself, our friend grabbed her drink and we went to our table.Everyone was in character the whole time. Our waitress was friendly. The food was a little expensive, but the drinks were priced for the neighborhood. There were quite a few vegetarian options. My problem was not with my experience from that day.

"This place is awesome! I found it thru Yelp and I had surprised my best friend with this place. I was so excited that I spilled the beans about what this place was about according to the reviews. I didn't know the password so I had to do something in order to get in but once I was in I tried to find the password. I got close but I'm not sure if I got it right. The drinks- Typically priced for Chicago. Most of their signature drinks are $14. I got two drinks with two shots of patron and the total was at $57. The one thing I'll say about their drinks is how SWEET they are. It's almost too sweet for me. The atmosphere-Amazing! There's a mission list you can check off and it was fun to take a part of that. You can take  photos in the stealthy selfie section and it was pretty fun. I ended up drinking too much and the bartenders could tell that they gave me water and kept the water going. I ended up puking on my walk to the bathroom that I had to leave. I felt so terrible they actually helped me out and didn't kick me out like most bars would.

"This is an overpriced tourist trap. After ordering 2 drinks, 1 order of cheese curds, and 1 burger, the bill came out to be $64 before tipping. $64! The burger was good, the cheese curds were average, and the drinks were meh at best. I was slightly hassled by the bartender for wanting blue cheese stuffed olives in my dirty martini, he made a big deal about himself having to make them.My friend and I sat at the back bar which was supposedly the ""magic"" bar, did not witness any of that. Maybe the magician wasn't feeling it while we were there. What we did witness (and heard) over and over was Austin Powers' voice saying ""YEAH BABY!"" Apparently, something was broken in the women's bathroom that connected to that voice, so it would play over and over rather loudly next to the ""magic"" bar.When we finished our drinks and paid the totally reasonably priced bill, we were told by the bartender that we could leave the cool way, which involves paying $1, or we could leave the regular way. We chose the regular way and we will not be returning.","3/13/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EM7zMsaSmYQuKZsf7UCR9w","Catherine C."

"Yes, kids, the rumors are true. I needed to do the hula dance to get in. I think I got off relatively light as I saw others having to wear face masks while doing a protracted pantomime. Oh, and as a bonus, all of these are shown inside the bar on CCTV so the patrons can witness the entrants' humiliations. Oh well, I guess that is what alcohol is for. As to the space itself, it is definitely a wander-around-and-look-at-things bar, not just a plant-yourself-on-a-stool bar. The selfie photo booth was a highlight and the decor abounds with a variety of pratfalls. I can see this place staying in business perhaps longer than I otherwise would have estimated, given the influx of tourists and corporate groups (as this location is twinned with the nearby Escape Room). The first time in is definitely an experience just to get the lay of the land/recon. It looks like someone spent quite a bit of time naming the drinks, as the clever names on the menu attest. Since it was happy hour, I went with a well drink (vodka and soda) for $5. I believe happy hour takes place from 4-6 pm with $5 beers and well drinks, and $6 wines. I came in because I wanted to check this place out, and because it was promoted as a tax-day relief special. I can ""safe"" ly say I will probably wait a little while to make a return visit.","4/20/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y1T7sd4TKOe4utqV5hFdMQ","Shanti N."

"Easily one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had. Don't let the red door perceive you, embrace your imagination and walk right in. From the moment you step in, you're captivated by the uniqueness of this place. You're a secret agent embarking on an important mission to fulfill your hunger/thirst needs. Take your time going through the intel, the black ops is dangerously delicious and the fried c4 is explosive. Sterling Archer would be quite proud of this operation. Without a doubt, the most enjoyable experience is making your way over to the magic bar. Whatever misconceptions you may have on the art of magic, let presto enlighten your evening.

Our bartender Xavier was also an amazing magician. He read my mind and bent a fork in my friends have. He was hilarious and had the crowd in stitches.The bartender/magician suggested the cheese curds and meatloaf. I'm not a meatloaf fan but he was definitely right, everything was tasty and fresh.

"Where to begin...came here after the escape room. Our party of 8 was seated for lunch at 1:30. Waited 20 mins to get water. Finally ordered and one of our party was informed that they ran out of the salad she ordered. She then opted for the fried chicken sandwich...they were also out of chicken. I mean c'mon. Food finally arrives and missing items galore. Forgot onion rings. Forgot chicken on the salad. Forgot dressings. Then the bill came. We opted to split 4 ways and then realized we were all overcharged. They continued the ""spy"" gimmick all throughout our infuriating experience. Learn when to drop the act and focus on service. Hope to God the location in Milwaukee is much better.","3/19/2017","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V0Xp2Mw7Vqpt2t8Do8uTgw","Joe D."

"heard about this through a news article and it peaked my interest. My girlfriend and I needed a place to the spend a fun Saturday night and she was okay with going here even though neither of us knew what to expect. It can be confusing getting in there and the admittance procedure is a lot of fun. We already ate so we just got a drink and appetizer which  were both good. The place is a little overpriced but you're kind of paying for the Ambiance. All the activities that they give you on a check list are fun albeit they're over pretty quickly once you know what you're doing. There are a lot of other things you could do in there that aren't on the checklist, some of which actually require some skills to figure out. I wonder if there are even deeper puzzles or everything I've done is all there is. I don't know about how this place would fare on multiple visits but I would at least go here one more time with people that haven't, just to see their reactions. If you have some money some friends and are wanting to have a very entertaining night with Intrigue, I recommend this place.","3/21/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JhfZjEKPkh7oZKkzUEbSRA","Derek P."

"5 star rating for atmosphere, 1 star rating for the food, leading to my average rating being 3 stars.  My boyfriend surprised me with SafeHouse.  Being a HUGE fan of James Bond, I appreciated a lot of the various memrobilia placed throughout the entire restaurant/bar.  Hell, they even had a photo of Walter Gotell who played General Gogol in the James Bond series (yes I'm really a Bond fan).  The decor, and memrobilia was spot on.  Exiting was a bit tricky, and I wound up swiping my car through the reader, later noticing there being a $1 pending charge on my debit card.  If I do get charged, I will be irritated, but not going to cry about it.  Every employee plays their part well, and although our waiter was a little too much into it, fast talking, and annoying, he did his job very well.The food was just not good for what you pay.  It is expensive.  I ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend ordered the fish n chips.  Our server recommended the cheese curds, which were surprisingly fantastic.  I even ordered a second while waiting for our food.  The meatloaf was cold, and tasted like straight italian sausage meat held together with breadcrumbs and pieces of green pepper.  There was also no other flavor or seasoning associated with it.  The mashed potatoes were not special; no buttery taste or seasoned with herbs.  The mushroom sauce covering the loaf and mashed potatoes was incredibly salty and heavy.  I tried the fried fish, which was bland, cold, and over fried.  Good fried fish is served literally out of the frier.Ultimately, I would return and try the burgers, as there seems to be a common thumbs up for those in the reviews here, but I don't really think of this place being a restaurant.  It's more so a really cool bar.  I'll give it some time, but will be back.  This is a great place to bring friends, and family when they're visiting the area.","3/13/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vL1KLD373oT-yxzBtQPdwQ","Joe M."

"Don't be intimidated by the International Exports employee at the entrance. Get past him, go down the stairs into the super-cool bar. It may seem a bit over the top, but the whole thing is way more fun if you play along. Our waiter told us to touch everything, nothing will hurt you. Exploring the details, pressing the buttons, opening the doors is the best part of the Safehouse. The second best thing (or things) are the cocktails. My favorite was the Spy's Demise, followed by the Vesper Lind. The food was excellent, I had the SR-71 sandwich, which was huge and I can attest re-heats well in the oven. Oh, and definitely get the cheese curds. And look for the secret menu items in the menu... they may take some decoding to figure out. Don't forget to look for clues for the password, to make getting in next time a little easier! I don't want to give away too much else, because that would take all the fun away.

"What should have been a fun Sunday lunch after completing the escape room next door turned into a 2-hr obnoxious ordeal. I felt like this place is all gimmick and the staff relies on that instead of knowing how to provide good service. I should have ordered my burger rare because the medium came out extra well done and completely dry. Our server couldn't have been slower, and after messing up my friends order twice we asked for the check and wanted to leave. We had the check split evenly between our cards and half came out 2x as much as the others, with the split bill totalling over $100 more than the initial bill. The manager had to totally cancel our transaction and start the bill from scratch to correct and it added about 20-30 min more waiting time.

I walked passed the door twice before I finally figured it out. I tried to open the door and was immediately told I needed to stay outside by this German character (this was part of the experience by the way). Once you walk inside you quickly realize you may not be in the right place as the sign says this is an export business. The German man asked our group how he can assist us with our shipping needs. One girl told him we were looking for SafeHouse and he had no idea what we were talking about. Once you figure out how to get in you will find one of the coolest restaurants/bars you have been to. Your quickly transported to a spy HQ from WWII complete with intel and secret mission objectives. The only password you will get in this bunker is for the WiFi so make sure you ask your waiter...I mean fellow agent. Also, watch out for double agents! I decided to have a martini, shaken not stirred of course, with a spy burger. The burger was great and cooked perfectly. I would recommend getting that and a side of fries.

All was fun until drinks are arrived - the drink ""Man with a copper mug"" $14 came in a basic glass. Hmmm. Really? After asking where the mug, got an answer - its investigated. OK, cool, how about if you run out of mugs tell me about that before I spend $14 and not even getting full experience. Then we got presented with a puzzle which we solved, being told that since we solved it we will get discount for the next time we visit it. Did we get it? Nope. So will I go there again? I doubt.

"If you've been to the SafeHouse Milwaukee, you'll be impressed with a modernized take on their spy themed restaurant.  But by ""modern"" I mean new, as it still has a totally 1960's feel.  There is so much to see, it's hard to take it all in.  The entry is fun and the exit (if you're willing to pay $1 for your entire party) is right out of a movie and you won't find anything like it anywhere else. The food was very good (the C4 fried cheese curd appetizer is homemade and the best I've ever had, the Mission Impossible burger was excellent and the Goldfinger grilled cheese was amazing - even had C4 cheese curds inside!) and the service was excellent.  The wait staff stays in character, which makes it lots of fun.  When you're finished eating, you'll want to look around and the staff knows you're going to take photos and every time they might bump into you, they say, ""Excuse me agent.""  They never break character.  The theme is spot on, but despite how fascinating the restaurant is, they have to still have great food and the SafeHouse Chicago wins on both counts.","3/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=wYgr9KK3VL4yjzJju6mJ8w","Steve T."

"YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED IN WITHOUT EITHER PASSWORD OR HUMILIATING YOURSELF! Really disappointed. Tried coming here on Thursday 3/23/17 and was turned away and not allowed in. There was a strange guy at the door with a mustache standing outside who said something about needing a light as i reached for the door to get in; I thought he was a homeless person or something bothering people on the sidewalk. I opened the door and went inside and he followed right behind me, which was creepy at first since he was right behind me. I didn't like this. Then I realized he worked at SafeHouse and was supposed to be working the room inside and greeting people (but he had been outside for some reason). I told him the password that I was given to get in but he said it wasn't right, but it's the password from the Milwaukee location. It should have worked. I didn't want to have to go through the big production of having to do a silly dance to be let in and he wouldn't let me in without doing that, so I left and went over to Lawry's Side Door and ate there instead. So SafeHouse lost out on the $50 I ended up spending at Lawry's. After work I just wanted to get a burger and have a few drinks so I wish you could skip the silly dance and nonsense. Maybe only make groups of people do that but have a way to come in without going through the nonsense if people don't want to. I wish I just knew the right damn password so I could avoid problems. I would come here in the future but I want to be able to skip the humiliation after having done it once. Not sure how long this place is going to stay in business if they keep turning people away.","3/25/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NVTxGyquoG-4aw2r1-3o0Q","Justin F."
"Was an awesome adventurous experience! Very glad we went. Don't wanna give away the details because it's more fun to experience it as it comes. If you're open to adventure and enjoy scavenger hunt/escape room type experiences you'll like it. Ordered the mac and cheese and smersh burger and enjoyed both.","3/26/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=a0BjhP0npsnqj3bvmU9Ong","Rum C."

"I checked out this place because of the Milwaukee location. The entrance schtick was classic, a lot of fun. You know you're on camera which is always good for a laugh. Walking down the hallway, down the stairs is exciting, however when the door opens to enter the restaurant, you're hit with the heart thumping boom boom boom of a night club with a DJ yelling Yo Yo Yo. Not the restaurant atmosphere you were hoping for. Fail. Around the side is the seating area but you're still overwhelmed with the club music. This is not a place you want to bring out of town guests unless they are under 25 and still wet behind the ears. The waitress was nice but you could tell she was over the whole 'hello agents' thing. The decor was pretty cool, it was fun looking around the restaurant at the spy stuff. The food was amazing. If there was a rating for just food, Id give it  5 stars. Other than that, I probably will not come back. I'll make the trip to Milwaukee to go to that one.","3/4/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EBb_sDokphh8jRERbJEQ2A","Chris B."

"Came to safehouse for lunch first time there. Cheese curds were amazing!!! Cane was our server and he made it fun. We had kids with us and they loved it and so did the adults. We will definitely be back without the little ones for the DJ one weekend!!","3/30/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zduneeouYdGxYXoyGbSzrg","Matthew W."
"My friends and I loved this place! Super cool spy themed restaurant, full of fun little oddities. A secret password is needed to get in, or they make you do embarrassing things. Max power interrogated us and it was so hilarious. Well worth your time once you follow the instructions. Agent Lux was our server, and made our experience really great. We shared the cheese curds which were awesome, and I ordered a black bean veggie burger which was delicious. Had a great time, we'll be back!","3/17/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=C1y1psQJD0GejlAh_z-EGA","Christie G."
"I have been to the original Safehouse in Milwaukee many times. This place is faithful to the original while having a more modern visual asthetic. It is more restaurant than bar, but I was there at dinner time. The original has more unique seating options such as private rooms and areas. I saw only one here. This place keeps up the spy theme through the entire meal with the playful words the waitresses use and asking everyone to create a code name. I liked the activities, few restaurants encourage people to get up and look around. The food was good and decently priced for the area. You do this place for the theme first and the food second. Agent Pandora (waitress) took great care of us and made the evening enjoyable. I would definitely come back.","3/24/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YJqVuWrnxSjqHJlOH_pQAg","Clayton J."
"It's tough to leave a review to this without spoiling the surprises it has in store for you.  It's a phenomenal secret agent themed restaurant/bar with a secret entrance.  If you walk thru the red door and enter in to what looks to be a doctor's office, just know you're not in the wrong place.  You'll enjoy figuring out the rest on your own.","3/21/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u_iI-MoemHcGzjCe1lU2ww","Dan S."
"Don't miss this with kids! Such a blast! Probably best for ages five and up. I avoid ""touristy"" places like Planet Hollywood or Rain Forest Cafe because I always find that the ""hook"" gets people in, but the food stinks, but WOW, the burgers here are AMAZING! Seriously great food, such unique, incredible fun. Your kids will talk about this place for years.","3/27/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=K95LkVyppn-hNT0iVr8cLg","Tracy T."
"I tired SafeHouse out during friends and family week. The entrance is a little hard to find because it's unmarked, but once I got in the door Agent Shakespeare took me into the spy world and really got me understanding what this whole place was about. She was great and very interactive. Now onto the food. It was definitely pricey for what it was. I'm a vegetarian myself so there weren't too many options. I got the grilled cheese, but it was way too greasy for my taste. Probably should have stuck to the salad. The environment was good and everyone stayed in spy character. Would be a good place for a girls night or bachelorette party type event. Exiting into the hotel was also pretty confusing. Overall it was so-so. I don't venture out to the city often but if I do find myself back in the area I would give it a second try.","3/18/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MFt7uszMLCmzXxzpuExyoA","Hannah S."
"I had so much fun here! Food is delish--I didn't know the password (wink, wink) but Agent Shakespeare made the clearance check a blast.","3/14/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hCEtjdgzORJOe38lnqW5sA","Taylor T."
