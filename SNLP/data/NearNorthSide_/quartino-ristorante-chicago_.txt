The restaurant was packed and very loud as it was a Saturday night. This was to be expected in Chicago in the summer. The food was fair to bad. We ordered 9 different small plates and each was lacking in flavor and prepared poorly by Chicago restaurant standards. We ordered Burrata, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Broccoli Rabe, Octopus, Shrimp Risotto, Calamari, Tuscan Kale salad and the Cavetelli. The cheeses were all very bland and tasteless, the seafood chewy, and the pastas gummy. We have been waiting to try this restaurant for months as it is consistently crowded and well reviewed. We left thinking we will never go back and wondering why it is so popular. Go to RPM Italian or Eataly nearby and get MUCH better Italian food.

We were sat at a table near the kitchen, which didn't bother me. Our server was very friendly, and did an excellent job. The portions were fair for the price, and the food really was nothing to complain about. The restaurant was packed as our server told us it always was, so the noise was nothing to complain about, it was expected. However, the noise that did bother me, but most importantly my mother, were the loud shouts of profanity we heard coming from the kitchen. As soon as the shouting ended, a character who appeared to be the head chef exited and began speaking with a table near us. It was then we realized this was the same guy who was doing the shouting.

The veal sliders were the best thing we ordered, the calamari OK, but the mushroom bruschetta was bland. The risotto (we ordered two kinds) was soupy (both of them). The pasta was salty. The desserts were a mixed bag. The profiteroles were very good, but the carmelized banana dessert was short on the bananas, and had too much average, flavorless vanilla ice cream.

My other friends ordered a 1/2 liter of Malbec from Argentina. I took one sip and instantly regretted ordering my Chianti. \u00a0We ordered a few tapas and shared them amongst the three of us. The concept is great. Only 1-2 appetizers are out on the table at a time. We started with gnocchi. The flavor was nice but to be honest it was over cooked and on the harder side. This was our least favorite item on the menu. Next came out the eggplant parm. Asides from it being on the saltier side., the taste was great. There was a nice balance of sauce and eggplant and the mozzarella cheese on top was melted to the right consistency. I was personally a huge fan of the dish. Next we got the only chicken dish on the menu. This was my favorite dish we ordered (asides from dessert of course). The flavors were great and the chicken was cooked to the perfect temperature. I highly suggest this dish as well! We also ended up getting penne vodka and it was like any other penne vodka. Nothing bad or extraordinary about it. Tasted great. For dessert we had tiramisu (not listed on dessert menu) and torta al chocolate, essentially a hot goey scrumptious chocolate cake served with gelato!

Turns out Hermes is nice, but my gloves did nothing to actually keep my fingers warm in freezing temps and wind.As soon as I arrived, about 10-15 minutes before my reservation I asked the gals at the host stand if I could please have a table near an outlet if they possibly had one in the restaurant. They had a good feeling they did, walked to the table to check then back to get me and I was seated to thaw out my hands over a nicely lit candle on the table (on their front inside patio terrace area) and charge up my phone with their electricity! :) I really appreciated the service right from the start.Enjoyed a 1/4 Litre of their Donati Ezio 13 Cab and the following: - Polenta Fries (the sauce was awesome the fries themselves ok, maybe not my fav version of polenta)- 1/2 order of their Baby Spinach salad (very good)- Pappardelle dish (very nice) and...- 1/2 order of their tiramiso (soooo good!)All in all this was the perfect warm spot to tuck away at for a fulfilling solo dining experience while in the city.

They had me at Hendricks, to be honest, but the taste profile was unlike anything I've had before. Perhaps, the balsamic made me think of a wine?Next up were the polenta fries, which are served with a tangy red sauce. These are really something.

I have found it to be one of the more affordable sit-down dining options in downtown Chicago, and I love the tapas-style pasta manner (because who doesn't want to snitch bites off of someone else's plate?).Quartino's was literally a stone's throw away from our hotel, and the atmosphere and staff were warm and inviting. We had reservations so we were seated quickly - I definitely suggest making reservations, because even though the two of us came in on a Monday night, it was non-stop busy.It was our last night in Chicago so we pigged out and over-ordered. Our server was Miguel, and he was excellent: very attentive and kind without being overbearing. Their Italian sodas (we had the raspberry and the blood orange flavors) were absolutely delicious.The first pasta plate we split was the tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. We are more used to the ground meat-type of Bolognese sauce (i.e., a mix of ground veal, pork, beef, etc.) and this sauce seemed like more of a shredded pork ragout. It wasn't bad but we did not love it. Our next shared plate was the porcini and truffle risotto. Again, this plate was a little disappointing, since I remember ordering it several years back with two girlfriends and we had LOVED this luxurious, rich dish. The risotto was VERY over-cooked, my daughter said it was too mushy. And every bite was oddly gritty, like the mushrooms hadn't been properly rinsed (it literally felt like I was crunching on sand). We next split the fettuccini alfredo and the sauce was extremely delicious and silky. HOWVER, the problem I had with both the tagliatelle and the fettucine was that both pastas were extremely chewy and dense (not al dente, but undercooked/chewy) and needed a heavier hand with the salt. I wanted to salt both dishes but resisted since this seemed sacrilegious...but someone back in the kitchen really forgot to salt the pasta water. \u00a0Our last shared course was the steamed clams and these were STELLAR. The broth was gorgeous and tasted delicious but unfortunately we were too full with the mediocre pasta dishes to fully enjoy this excellent dish!I really think this was an off night for the kitchen, pasta-wise. I still love Quartino's and I fully intend to come back the next time we are in Chicago. The total bill for TONS of food and two Italian sodas/refills was about $60 (before tip for the excellent service) which you will be hard pressed to top elsewhere downtown.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FcBDHJQEJ_n0RV4hZsJu9A", "user_name": "Anna S."}, {"review_date": "3/16/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "review": "This is a great place to go to when you're craving Italian but aren't ready to commit to just one dish. \u00a0I came in with 4 other people and we ended up ordering an array of pretty tasty dishes. \u00a0For me, the best deal and best tasting dishes were the cheese and meat board, tortellini, and the artisan Italian sausage. \u00a0The tortellini had just the right amount of creaminess and the sausage was seasoned well. \u00a0And of course, it's so much fun making your own cheese and meat board and I would imagine is a huge hit for most tables. \u00a0My least favorite were the octopus and the portabella risotto. \u00a0The risotto was gritty to me like the mushrooms used were still a little dirty. \u00a0The octopus was definitely chewy and not something I would get again. \u00a0Overall, a great restaurant option and a very fun place to come with a group of friends.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Oavbr8dUe96Ap75kSwHhww", "user_name": "Lily F."}, {"review_date": "2/28/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Hands down to one of the best Italian restaurant I've ever had.

It's a couple bucks up charge, but it goes great with apples!!I'm not a veal eater, but I will make an exception for their veal meatballs!

It's a simple dish, which sometimes can yield the best dishes.The short rib is also a must! It's hearty and very well-prepared! I love it! Even their salads are worth ordering! The Brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite! It's super-light, but incredibly flavorful!! Love it!! The kale salad is pretty great, too.One of their cheese plates at one time came with green grapes with parsley, lemon juice and EVOO. Weird, right? Wrong!! DELICIOUSLY WEIRD!

You can choose three courses from a great variety of items including soup, salad, pasta, seafood, risotto, etc. As I have been here for many times, I would share my experience with the lunch special. I had the minestrone soup - fresh, light, and hearty. People speak highly about their tapas sharing plates and pizza. You know this restaurant is a good one when they offer good soup although it's not their big items; they pay close attention to prepare fine quality food. Truffle risotto is good with strong mushroom taste. If you are someone who loves mushrooms. I'd suggest to try. Otherwise, I'd suggest asparagus risotto or shrimps one that are both amazing. Not every place cooks good risotto but you can definitely trust this place. The biggest compliment this place wins my heart is their seafood. I particularly recommend their steam clam and combination seafood. My picture is the combination seafood. The sauce is great, the seafood is fresh, and the bread is buttery and crispy from the grill. I know Midwest is not the best for finding seafood but you can trust this place. If you are looking for a nice place to catch up with friends though, this place might be a bit crowded and loud for you.

Finally seated at 8:30, we ordered an app and soup each. The calamari was tender and crispy pairing well with the tangy marinara. He said the chicken with risotto soup was tasty. I had the minestrone soup which was a bit different. Full of white beans and no tube shaped macaroni. While still quite delicious, where the frick were my macaroni noodles? Did they forget it or was it Quartinos take on minestrone?Super speedy service and entrees were delivered quickly to the table. The bread was rather stale and nothing to write home about. They also think a 750ml water for 2 will do when the entrees are a tad bit salty. Rigatoni was not al dente, but rather undercooked as the kitchen was trying to spew out orders and the ground lamb was minimal as can be. The papparadelle was also undercooked and 1 long ribbon was drenched in stew like consistency topped with unforgivable Kraft Parmesan instead of fresh cheese cranked beside your table.

Everything was just okay. Wasn't blown away by any of the things we ordered, to be honest. For the bruschette, I wish that they would've put all the toppings on each piece of bread instead of having just eggplant on one and mushrooms on another. It made it difficult to get a taste of each one and we ended up having to take turns taking bites. Sadly, the gnocchi was ended up being our least favorite. It was not light and fluffy like you would expect, and it would get stuck to the fork when we took a bite. The texture of it was totally off and tasted bland. Big disappointment (especially because it's a house made pasta). The only dish that we thought was worthy was the tortellini with prosciutto. Our server, Aldo, was great though.

Our table was also shoved against a wall with a shit ton of stuff on it (plates, plate holder, etc) when the table was pretty small in size to begin with, and it was next to the kitchen so my chair was either kicked or in the way of every single person going in and out of the kitchen (due to the narrowed walking space because of the large 16 lady party). Both parties on either side of us were SO extremely loud, to the point that they were all literally yelling to each other and shouting over each other to be heard. My husband and I were so incredibly irritated. Who yells in a restaurant? And who does it with zero respect for the other poor victims who were sat near you? There were 2 gals clearly trying to have a girls night out dinner and those poor souls were sat behind us so they had to deal with the noise too. I heard them complain to the manager, but she offered really no sympathy. The noise literally ruined what was supposed to be a nice celebratory dinner for my husband and me, and we couldn't wait to eat and get the hell out and find somewhere quieter to get dessert.

The place was packed. It was for a friend's bday. She liked this place a lot a few years ago. But unfortunately, it didn't hold up to expectations.Side note: they have a really bad waiting area. They should remove the two tables by the front and place benches here or something. There is no where to stand after you enter the revolving doors and it turns into a sumo wrestling match with servers, hostesses, people trying to get to the packed bar and patrons. Really bad setup that makes no sense. The people seated at the two front tables cannot possibly enjoy their meal because they have people standing right on top of them, and they have a door constantly opening letting in cold air in their faces.The food was mediocre largely due to a lack of seasoning. Everything was under seasoned including the gnocchi with arugula pesto and shrimp risotto. I have never had to put salt and pepper on everything that came out of a kitchen before, but we had to on 4 of our 5 items we ordered. The only thing that I'd consider to be really good were the dates (with pancetta I think). The short rib was OK but kinda tasted like pot roast. Strongly suggest some sort of quality control on what goes out of the kitchen. There's no reason a risotto and a pesto should be under salted, those are two basic things that need a lot of salt in the kitchen.

HOWEVER, after having been kindly reached out to by the staff and assured a wonderful experience, we decided to give Quartino another go.I left the restaurant with a full stomach and happy heart. We were sat at a table near the kitchen which was nice and roomy which I appreciated as the rest of the building was packed. The manager and wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly. They made sure our experience was great as well as the food. We started out the meal with some bread (I still feel like the bread they give you at the table isn't that great, but the rest of the food made up for that) and some seasonal cocktails. I had a pumpkin spice mai tai and my friend got a moroccolo (or something like that!). Both were pretty boozy but delicious. Next some appetizers were brought out for us. A toast with a DELICOUS fluffy goat cheese spread, bacon wrapped blue cheese filled dates, and a meat platter with (I believe) pickled onions of some sort. All of the appetizers were delicious, especially the meat sampler and goat cheese. For entrees we went with fettuccini (homemade noodles, yum!) and the shrimp risotto. Both delicious. The alfredo sauce was light and not too overpowering. The risotto was heavy but nice and creamy. Portions were a bit small but that was fine because we had so much other food.For dessert, the manager sent us THREE different things to try. The warm donuts with dark chocolate and honey dipping sauces were nice and fluffy. The dark chocolate dipping sauce was incredible! The tiramisu was rich and fluffy and moist and was exactly what we were craving. Best of all was lemon cream gelato sandwiched between some sort of lemon cookie/cake on top of a lemon curd that I could eat spoonfuls of. So good!I felt like a queen and a food critic at the same time with the variety and amount of delicious food that was sent our way. The staff here was so kind and I am so glad to have given this place another chance. \u00a0Thank you Quartino for an amazing dining experience, and thank you to Alysia for having us.I realize that everyone has their off days and that my dining experience the first time didn't correctly reflect the quality of food here.

They can even accommodate larger groups: I was recently there with 12 + a baby and we got a private room!I'd say to aim for 1.5 to 2 dishes per person. There's lots of good things to try!Some personal favorites:-Gnocchi in pesto sauce-Tortellini with peas and prosciutto-Tagliatelle in bolognese sauce-Pizzas are neapolitan style and really good tooFor dessert the chocolate torta and zeppole (Italian delights) are delightful.You really can't go wrong at Quartino!", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HpZsXNBSkWZ-0HaYOjLaWA", "user_name": "Michael V."}, {"review_date": "12/14/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "So I'm back AGAIN.

You will be served with complimentary bread which actually tastes pretty good with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We settled for the $25 lunch special which essentially allowed us to choose three different dishes from the main sections of the menu. Our choices ended up being the beet salad, linguine with clams, and the calamari.I am a fan of beets and the salad did not disappoint. The salad contained beets and burratta cheese. It seemed as if there were two different kinds of beets in the salad. One came in the cubed form and was juicy and flavorful while the other came in a sliced form and tasted more like sliced carrots. I definitely enjoyed eating the cubed beets more since the sliced beets were pretty flavorless and dry. The burratta was extremely creamy and burst when I cut it with a fork. Although the flavoring of the cheese itself was a bit watered down, it complemented the strong flavor of the cubed beets well.The linguine with clams dish was actually smaller than I was expecting. There was the option of a red or white sauce with this dish and we opted for the white. The sauce was a wine sauce so it was not creamy. For pasta, I thought the linguine dish was actually pretty light. After I finished eating, I did not feel weighed down. The clams were pretty tiny and there weren't that many unfortunately.Ordering the calamari was a mistake. I need to remember that eating fried foods in large quantities is neither enjoyable nor desirable. The portion size for this order was pretty big and we were unable to finish the dish completely. In addition, the calamari was a bit soggy which made it even more difficult to consume. This was definitely one of the weaker dishes we had ordered.On top of the lunch special, my friend and I mistakenly ordered the Gran Coppa Quartino dessert. The description of the dessert may seem tempting, but let me warn you that it is actually just a very mediocre, overpriced dessert in disguise. The gelato tasted extremely artificial and the screaming shade of pink of the strawberry gelato did not help one bit.If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal for lunch, stopping by Quartino and getting the $25 lunch special is actually not a bad deal. I certainly regret ordering the dessert which cost an additional $8. Skip on the dessert here and you'll walk away with a decent lunch experience without having your wallet drained.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xdHM5YCDlHVFTPOPWESwMw", "user_name": "Karen Q."}, {"review_date": "7/24/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "Our go-to shared plates restaurant when friends come to visit us! \u00a0Great vegetarian and gluten-free options and a wide selection of thin crust pizzas and pastas!

We were seated at a small table in the room that fronts State Street. The room was dark, cozy, and intimate-the perfect ambiance for our date night. I suggest trying to get a table in here! It's better than the main dining room, in my opinion.We started with the dates wrapped in pancetta, delicious. Next was the wild arugula salad. It wasn't bad, but I was a tad underwhelmed. I was hoping there would be more farro. We then had the duck prosciutto. The prosciutto itself was great--salty and savory. It was served with a small pickled vegetable salad that was overly spicy and honestly, unnecessary. The shrimp dish was good, but the shrimp was overcooked. They weren't tender, as shrimp should be. Now onto the highlights of the meal: pasta!! We had the tortellini and the orecchiette. The tortellini was served with Alfredo, parmesan, peas, and prosciutto and was literally to die for. It was clearly the highlight of the meal and one of the best pasta dishes I have had in quite some time. The orecchiette was served with a fennel sausage ragu and complimented and contrasted the tortellini well. Also, the pasta dishes here are quite large. I would say they are more entree sized than tapas sized.And then dessert. If you are going to get only one dessert, get the Gran Coppa Quartino. I'm assuming it's what they're known for. It's vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate gelato served in a martini glass with fresh berries and a giant biscotti. It was fantastic and the presentation was beautiful. We also ordered the zeppole. The zeppole was good, but it's a huge portion. I think it came with eight pieces. My only complaint? They pretty much give you shot glasses for your wine.

We had initially planned on being seated outdoors (and people watching!) but the weather was too warm and sticky for that.The hosts (there appeared to be 3!) were all smiles and seated us quickly to a window facing table for a happy compromise. The place was packed and got noisier with laughter and banter as the evening progressed. The ambience is all mood lighting and on the fancier side, so we were happy that we'd all dressed up.Side note: the tables are close enough that the group next to us tapped me on my shoulder twice to ask me what we had ordered because it looked SO good.Speaking of the food, it was one those meals that I'll reminisce about for a long time! We split a bottle of prosecco, and ordered one entree each, skipping the appetizers in favor of dessert (which is my favorite thing to have when I'm out dining). The menu had plenty of non-meat entr\u00e9es, which pleased my vegetarian friend. We asked the server for suggestions and she made up in friendliness what she seemed to lack in knowledge of the menu.We got the potato gnocchi, which came with one of the most delicious pesto sauces I've had in a while; the linguine with clams in a marinara sauce that was seasoned and spiced perfectly, and the eggplant parmesan, which was my least favorite dish, but which my dining companions seemed to enjoy a lot.The portions are decent sized, and unless you have a really large appetite, stick to sharing dishes like we did. Also, all our dishes came out at different times, which was kind of awkward.Then came dessert, and we agonized over the ridiculously tantalizing menu until we decided on the profiteroles and the Nutella panino. The sugar sprinkled Nutella panino was a great Nutella toast, but too simple and easy replicable to be on that menu.

Everything is shared small plates so we ordered eggplant Parmesan, broccoli rabe, gnocchi, and porcini and truffle Risotto. The eggplant Parmesan dish came out piping hot and no one warned my husband. He burnt himself. The dish tasted great though, and the marinara was really fresh. The next dish that came out was the broccoli rabe. It was fantastic-definitely our favorite. Then the Risotto... we LOVE risotto! Theirs however was terrible. The rice was undercooked and the porcini mushroom dirt overpowered the dish. There were several gritty bites as if they put the rehydrated water into the dish and didn't discard the dirt debris. Lastly the gnocchi-it had undercooked potatoes and green beans that overpowered the dish and the gnocchi tasted grainy like it needed another minute to cook. We gave the place a 3 for the broccoli, eggplant, the wine, and the service. The ambiance and the other 2 dishes were bad enough that we probably won't be back.

Halfway through, we decided to order the Fiocco di Prosciutto, which was a nice way to end our dinner. I would definitely come back for the food, as it really is phenomenal. The service was amazing. Albeit, we did go 4-5pm, when there was less customers, but the servers were very attentive. Unfortunately, I did not get our waiter's name, but he was very nice and definitely very energetic.

The sauce was VERY sweet and lacked any real sofrito flavor or if u like marinara bolognese it did not have that going for it either... GNOCCHI- ok the arugula pesto is really pushing it. It tastes like pure arugula which any of my salad eating friends out there knows tastes like DIRT plain. They should know a normal pesto w basil, garlic, and pine nuts would much better serve their hand rolled gnocchis. And when I say \"THE BAD\" I mean I pushed it away with my fork and did not eat it.

The meat itself was tender and seasoned nicely. I only spotted 2 tentacles, but the other pieces were so well done that it didn't matter. The soprano pizza was divine, and the crust made it. Sure the veal meatballs brought the base flavor profile, but the crust had just the right amount of chew and crispy texture. We had to be so careful not to devour the whole thing in one sitting, otherwise, we would have not been able to eat the rest of the food!We ended the night with a delicious dessert of zeppoles. They are fried doughnuts, but so airy and fluffy. To accompany each bite are dark chocolate and honey. The combination of the two sauces together is like experiencing nirvana. Absolutely loved every bite, and for $6.25, it was plenty for the two of us.Each dish that we had ranged in prices from $10-$15, and there was plenty of food to take home. We ordered 4 savory dishes and 1 dessert, and we could have easily just gone with 2 dishes and the dessert. However, the leftovers reheat wonderfully.With a convenient and central location to Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhood, Quartino is easy to find, and will leave you and your family members happy. For bigger parties, make reservations online or via phone. They have an upstairs area that offers a great view of the city if you're looking for that.

But this is the one place that has changed my mind.. get it. done deal!- Veal meatballs (traditional style): Tender, juicy, and just the right about of sauce without masking the natural flavors of the meat itself. Get it.-Baby Spinach salad: lackluster and the table did not finish it. Pass on it..-Penne alla vodka: I love a good vodka sauce and this was a perfect touch to getting a few bites of a heavy pasta without feeling weighed down. Creamy and silky with bold but simplistic flavors.. get it!-Broccoli rabe- it's is rabe and not traditional broccoli florets, it tastes similar to a sauteed spinach with more texture. Pleasantly surprised with the bold garlic notes and a pinch of spice. Get it!-Octopus: If it haven't said it enough in my reviews, Chicago is my all time favorite city to get octopus plates, and Quartino did not disappoint!

The closeness and loud atmosphere is what we look for when we go out to eat (fun atmosphere!), but if you prefer a quieter dining environment this may not be the place for you. Our server seated us right when we got there and promptly got us menus and water. The theme of Quartino is essentially Italian tapas. Our server got me a gluten free menu right away and the g free menu was quite impressive (especially for an Italian restaurant!). The g free menu had the \"normal\" gluten free things like cheese, salami, antipasti but also a gluten free fusilli (pasta) that could be prepared the same was as their normal pastas. COOL. We tried several of the tapas; the stuffed dates (AMAZING), asparagus risotto, caprese salad, gluten free fusilli with the sausage marinara, and broccoli rabe (spicy A F). The food was awesome and we loved that like a traditional tapas restaurant they brought the food out when it was ready so you can kind of graze the whole night. Wine is purchased by the carafe.

Unfortunately, the table set up was more appropriate for 14 people than 16 so I went to speak with the host. \u00a0To their credit, they said that they would take care of things right away and about 5 minutes later, after a table next to us freed up, they pushed it over and we settled in, more comfortably this time.While a bit irritating, I put the initial issues down to the fact that we were at a busy Chicago restaurant on a Friday night...unfortunately, things did not get better. \u00a0I had pre-ordered 3 Salumeria tasting (antipasti) plates. \u00a0A few minutes after we sat down the first plate arrived. \u00a0Maybe 5 minutes after that, the second plate arrived. \u00a0Probably another 6-7 minutes later , the 3rd plate arrived. So it was almost 15 minutes before some people had food! \u00a0These were pre-ordered and consisted of a mix of charcuterie, cheese and assorted pre-made vegetable antipasti (which were good)...there was no reason that all of the plates could not have been prepared and delivered to the table at once. \u00a0Very strange.Then we ordered the mains. \u00a0The waiter warned us that the dishes would be brought out as they became available...which was fine. \u00a0That said, I was not prepared for the fact that my linguine with clams came out about 3 minutes later...and probably 7-10 minutes before anyone else got food. \u00a0I guess I could have understood it if everyone at our table who ordered linguine with clams was served at the same time, but that was not the case. \u00a0The best I could figure is that they had an extra one from someone else's order so they gave it to me. Needless to say I was finished before most people at the table were served.Again, all of this would have been forgiven if the food was good, but it was not. \u00a0My linguine was way over cooked and bland. \u00a0My wife's shrimp risotto tasted like lightly seasoned rice that they put a couple of shrimp on top of. \u00a0I had a slice of my nephew's pepperoni pizza and it could have been something from the freezer section. \u00a0My daughter said that her tagliatelle alla Bolognese was also meh. \u00a0I have been to Italy numerous times and I know what good Italian food tastes like...this was not it (To the people who have written Yelp reviews saying that this is the best Italian food in Chicago, I have news for you - it is not even the best Italian food in River North).On the plus side, the wait staff were competent and friendly. \u00a0They generously gave our table an extra pizza that was going to go to waste in the kitchen and they took a soda off of the bill that my young nephew ordered but didn't like. And the prices are very reasonable (most pasta and mains are between $11 and $15)...although the portions are not huge (the waiter said that things were family style but they were a little small to share between 2 people).Despite what I had heard about this being a chef-driven Italian restaurant, I would categorize it as more of a mass market Italian-American restaurant minus the overwhelming portions.

The penne vodka was okay, I think the sauce was a little weak, so I would not recommend that dish specifically (however, I am pretty biased because I make a killer vodka sauce).I would DEFINITELY eat here again.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iqLzp5jQn5Hnp6bxQpMDdA", "user_name": "Will K."}, {"review_date": "11/20/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "If I could give Quartino 10 stars I would. My parents and I were in Chicago in July of this year for a Cubs game and after researching restaurants I made a reservation here. SO GLAD I DID. One of the best meals we have ever had. Started out with the Salumeria tasting which was an absolute delight. We chose roasted vegetables, cheeses, meats...the olives. Wow. They also brought out polenta sticks on the house - which was a nice surprise! My dad had pizza; mom ravioli and I had the spaghetti and added meatballs. Wine of course, was the perfect addition to the meal. Mom and Dad split dessert and I finished with a glass of Prosecco. And having to unbutton my pants. HA! Make a reservation for a culinary experience that is very similar to my Nona.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=frVBhLcVaeMm5Fbe_NzJIQ", "user_name": "Renee W."}, {"review_date": "5/1/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "review": "I had dinner with a group of ten friends in the wine room and it was wonderful.

We dined no a Friday night and were seated on the patio. After about 20 minutes a server showed up and took our drink orders. Another 20 minutes went buy and another server brought us some bread but the drinks had yet to show up. I eventually commented and asked about the status of our drinks and 15 minutes later another server showed up with 2 of the 3 drinks we ordered. Our meal went on like this with continuous changes in servers and it even took 30 minutes to get the check let alone another 25 minutes to get my credit card back. For such a nice establishment the server confusion was very disappointing. We tried the Caprese salad which was fantastic and absolutely fresh and I highly recommend it. We also the meatballs which I had to remind the server twice to receive and were fairly small and somewhat chewy. (I'm guessing they forgot about it and reheated them or something). As for the pasta we ordered the Cavatelli we asked for it to be spicy. The pasta itself was great and the sauce definitely tasted homemade however there was no spice and 15 minutes later some crushed red pepper was brought to the table. Overall I was really looking forward to eating on the patio here and I do think they have a solid drink menu and great beer selection. I wish our experience was different as the food was on point but the service was unacceptable. Considering we had guests in town and chose to take them here was a bit of a mistake. Hopefully it is not always like this.

Being from out of town, I'm always looking for good places to try, especially Italian food which is my favorite. We ordered the arugula salad with hazel nuts, orange slices, and their own goat cheese. It was fantastic. For the entre, we ordered linguini and shrimp. It was the best I've had. For dessert we had the flamb\u00e9 banana with ice cream....can you say insanely good? We had s couple of wine pairing that went great with the food. Our server was very polite and attentive.

They offer a huge menu of affordable Italian tapas- come expecting to share food and leave picky friends at home. The vibe is trendy, service is good, but it's a little loud. Food rundown:Sopprestta and provolone cheese plate- really tasty and a good deal for the price. Served with unique garnishes. Definitely recommend picking a meat and cheese on the menu to start. Orange and arugula salad- fruit was fresh and the salad was light, but it's probably not worth it. Save your money for more pasta. Spaghetti pomodoro- meh. A sign of a good Italian restaurant is that the most simple dishes are incredible, and this one missed the mark. Tortellini- really delicious. Definitely recommend sticking with their fresh pasta dishes. While it's heavy, I could have eaten a whole plate. Profiteroles- big portion, high quality ice cream and chocolate syrup. Worth it. Would definitely come back to Quartino again and again, but would look elsewhere if I'm in the mood for authentic, classic Italian food.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=shdED0bG-r5SmX84wyZ4dA", "user_name": "Rachel Z."}, {"review_date": "10/18/2015", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating", "review": "Pros: HUGE space. If you have a big party, come here and they will seat you for sure AND bring out your food super fast. Our server was even nice enough to split our bill for us because my group was not good at math or somethingCons: the food is just not that good. Sad but true. Had the parpadelle, which was too salty and missing the satisfying meatiness (that's what she said) of the ragu. The steamed clams were a miss too - they were small probably frozen clams. I guess I'm used to juicy Manila clams. Maybe Chicago doesn't do clams?? I do highly recommend the mussels at Publican though...Conclusion: I've definitely seen better. Will not be back. If you're craving Italian, head to Siena tavern few blocks away instead!", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=W6iqpnFvnKUtQGY4kfHOaw", "user_name": "Maggie H."}], "fake_review_count": 220}
