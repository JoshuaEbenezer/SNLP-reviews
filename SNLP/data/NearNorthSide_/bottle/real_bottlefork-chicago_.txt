[{"review": "Went in for lunch today. Waited five minutes to be greeted by a host. When we were greeted it was to an icy reception. We were seated at the chef's counter where we waited 10 minutes for water by our brusque server. She poured out water and went off to waiting other tables for 20 minutes before we stood up and left. Very disappointed as this was one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I also have sent Bottlefork thousands dollars in business since opening.

If they had any kinks, which I don't expect them too because it's rockitranch, then they clearly fixed them.I had a great expereince. The food was perfect, the ambiance was different and very interesting. I was pleaslanty surprised that they took the time for their decor and for service. Everyone was extremly friendly and more than accomdating. I had a few drinks here, and everything seemed to be very on point. If you are in the area, check this place out. I am hoping that it stays exactly the same.

Great food and very reasonably priced. The food was very good, and there were many choices even for those on a restricted diet (I'm gluten free). \u00a0My husband had the bag of crisps with the egg, the mediterranean salad and fresh cavatelli pasta, while i had the chicken liver & foie gras Mousse and the smoked lamb ribs. We finished with the warm cheesecake and a ice cream sundae.My husband also had the Bill Brasky, which contains 7 different types of alcohol. He loved it. The ice cube in the drink was an art piece. \u00a0 \u00a0We would definitely go back to try other items on the menu!", "review_date": "4/14/2014", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name ":
