"Went in for lunch today. Waited five minutes to be greeted by a host. When we were greeted it was to an icy reception. We were seated at the chef's counter where we waited 10 minutes for water by our brusque server. She poured out water and went off to waiting other tables for 20 minutes before we stood up and left. Very disappointed as this was one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. I also have sent Bottlefork thousands dollars in business since opening. Those recommendations end today.","12/16/2015","1.0 star rating","JG5Hizhl35lCE0xqrYGomw","K.c. S."

"Visited 1-16-15.Had the tots, which were good--but are basically just big fried mashed potatoes with cheese sauce.  The Mediterranean Salad which was alright but drenched in dressing and overly tangy.  My entree was the Orechhiette Pasta, which was very average.  Fiancee loved her entree, the grilled octopus & spam.I got the pretzel caramel sundae for dessert, which was delicious minus the gelatinous blob of beer foam on top.","1/20/2015","3.0 star rating","V0HmCahHG__lRNr5M9bd0w","Oscist .."

"The place is cool--very hip, way to spendy for lunch and not enough menu items. The also appeared to not have enough staff. The guy waiting on us seemed to be waiting on the whole restaurant. Because of this we had to ask for our drinks twice. Food was ok--didn't warrant the price tag. I was bummed because I was very excited to try this place out. Charging $15+ for an entree and not including a side it a bit over the top even for downtown. Plus I had a$10 coupon from registering which the waiter forgot to deduct and I got tired of waiting for him to return since I was on my lunch HOUR. I'd go back for drinks and to hang out but probably wouldn't spend the money on dining here again.","7/9/2014","3.0 star rating","qgrQ2cAFkK4MP2fJBZFUNQ","Jen N."
"I tried the bloody mary with the bloody buddy.m.sat at the bar and ordered the scallops and ensalada latina.lunch wasn't especially busy and i was able to get a table right away.i loved the creamed kale mashed up in the fried egg! Â the small pieces of bacon reminds me of lardon and i love everything about this dish.i was really hankering for the squash flatbread but it was towards the end of the night and half the menu options were off the table.the place is super packed but based on the dishes we ordered; it isn't clear why.our sights were set on beverages.we stopped in for lunch on a friday.5 excruciating minutes later it arrives.","11/9/2016","4.0 star rating","6dwHcjbeBIvUPOO6cU0CVQ","Chris M."

"Love love love the cocktails. The always snow in your driveway is awesome. We tried the tots- spicy and more of a hash brown than tot but good. The wagyu beef jerky was just ok. The tuna crudo is excellent. But the burger is why we came it was written up in the Tribune. It was good I would say one of the top 10 burgers in the city. To end we had the strawberry shortcake sundae with homemade soft serve is excellent. Overall I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was excellent.

"Delicious food! Very yummyI went with a group of friends, we had a wonder time. Our seats were great and the atmosphere was very pleasant.However, i would recommend they increase the proportions. For instance we were a group of 4 we ordered around $200 worth of food and we still left hungry.The gnnochi was $17 and when the plate came it was so small like your feeding a baby we wanted to share the food but we were not even able to.The plate of scallops for $16 came with 2 scollops !!! i mean it was just to much. We played so much and received so little.We ordered like 7 different dishes , we had more plates then food.We said we would never come back just cause of the portions we received. hope they enhance on that","4/30/2016","4.0 star rating","KOL39M09GzS253HedPkF3Q","Hafida H."

Thinking we wouldn't be able to get a seat, we were about to leave when we were greater by the new manager, Hat Guy. He said he would check on if any bar seats were opening up and insisted on getting us a drink while we waited. Hat Guy got us a seat within a couple of minutes and we had some yummy appetizers. Hat Guy was running around the place making sure everything was running smoothly but made time to keep checking on us.

They have half off carafes of wine on Tuesday which was a pleasant surprise. Make sure to try the mediterranean salad as it has grilled saganaki cheese. The only downfall is that the bathrooms are small and there is sometimes a wait. All in all I will be back for some more.

"Delicious. My wife and I were able to get a reservation on a busy Thursday night about half an hour before we showed up. We sat at bar seats in front of the chefs and enjoyed watching all the dishes come out. Cocktails are pricey but unique and not overdone. Outstanding burger cooked medium rare, one of the better ones I've had in Chicago recently. Lobster/foie/fried oyster poor boy is a tasty and well-spiced take on the traditional lobster roll. Finally, the deserts looked great but we were too stuffed to try at the end. Will definitely go back to enjoy one of the multiple other appetizing dishes on the menu. Oh, and service was great. They noted us watching all the dishes come out and when we commented on how tasty the smoked salmon deviled eggs looked, the chef pushed the eggs to us, on the house.","7/31/2015","5.0 star rating","I8fgZy1LJeySwBGkmU5iFg","PJ L."
"We stopped in a whim and had the best afternoon we have had in a long time.  We sat at the bar for a drink and the bartender recommended a fine whiskey drink and my wife had a craft beer.  We chatted up the staff and each other and just enjoyed the day.  I overheard the chef (A young guy named Eric Lopez ) chatting with some other people and I asked about the grits he was serving with the soft shell crab special.  He talked lovingly about the grits, but also cooking food in general.  Being a chef is a tough racket, but I really got the sense there is nothing he would rather be.  his creativity and pride just gushed onto the plate.    It was the simple the tastiest most complex thing I have eaten in a long time.It was pricey, but somethings are worth it.  Finding a gem like this in a big city is one of them","5/19/2015","5.0 star rating","fginmhwtwoiCuhKiiSAcbQ","Oscar R."
"The perfect date night spot! Bottlefork has the best service I have ever received at a restaurant.

"Bottlefork has delicious food (a seasonally-changing menu containing items like pork shank, octopus, scallops, smoked olives, house jerky) and cocktails done very well, each dish or drink having a small tweak to make it their own, notable version (e.g., potato chips coated with a poached egg - they're excellent). I've eaten here twice, and both were wonderful dinners. Beyond that, they also go out of their way to make sure you and your party have a great experience! I have an extremely severe dairy allergy and our server on the most-recent visit, Nick G., and the chef, Eric L., both took the time to talk to me about the menu before ordering, including what modifications could be made to various dishes. (As always, I made sure to call ahead and inform the staff of my allergy when making reservations.) Nick and Eric were each vigilant about making sure my food was not only tasty, but completely dairy-free. Their genuinely-caring approach made for a wonderful, allergy-free, and delicious dinner with friends and family. I will definitely be back!","4/27/2015","5.0 star rating","UfaYQUWjP8nLrdovYHNZ6g","Brandon L."

"What a great place. From the first drink made by the bartenders to the dessert, I could not have been more pleased. The cocktails are well thought out (smoke of the day is always a good choice). Food is superb. Lobster rolls, the burger, pork belly, orecchiette pasta are all great entree choices. Great starters are Bag 'O Crips, deviled eggs, etc. Pretty much anything on the menu is tasty and will make you happy depending on what you want. Desserts are to die for and change daily. I would recommend this place to any local or visitor. You will have a great time with great service and even better food/drinks.","1/18/2015","5.0 star rating","ds1DGynJv4jQFvfCRuquiQ","Charlie L."

We finished with the warm cheesecake and a ice cream sundae.My husband also had the Bill Brasky, which contains 7 different types of alcohol. He loved it.
