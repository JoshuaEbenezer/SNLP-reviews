[{"review": "Twice now I've been to Bottlefork and twice now I've walked away deeply satisfied. The first evening I sat at the bar and had excellent service, excellent cocktails, excellent gnocchi, and a cheesecake dessert special that may or may not have changed my life.The second time I sat at a table where I had superb service, superb 1/2 off happy hour wine, superb gnocchi (yes, again), several bites of my friend's superb cheese plate, and then sat back in deep lamentation over the fact that they had the cheesecake on special again and I couldn't possibly eat another bite.In other words, I adore this place. I intend to come here again and again. I recommend you do as well.

I have not been here for brunch yet, but it is definitely next on my to do list!I recently started a Chicago food blog and one of my upcoming posts is going to be about my favorite burgers in Chicago. As I was thinking through places I have been, as well as places that I want to visit, Bottlefork automatically came to my mind. Their burger is awesome! During our most recent visit my husband asked if I loved the burger because of the patty or the toppings and I honestly couldn't decide between the two! Ironically, shortly after our visit Bottlefork asked me a similar question in response to a photo I posted on Instagram and Twitter. My response was that I now have an excuse to come back and try the burger multiple times because right now it is too hard to pick a favorite part! Side note: I love a good crispy pickle and the pickle that comes on top of the burger is so good that I request a second one before I am finished, so I suggest you do also!I know I jumped right into the burger during this review, but I should back up and talk about the bag of crisps and egg that I typically order as an appetizer because it is pretty awesome as well! Basically they bring you a bag of potato chips and small bowl of a slow cooked egg, sea salt, and malt vinegar. They then empty the bowl of gooey goodness into the bag of chips and shake like crazy -- the end product...heaven. The chips are emptied into a bowl and they are ready to be devoured. This is a must order.During our last visit the daily dessert was a made to order cheesecake which we ordered ala mode, but I kid you not, the ala mode was a huge sunday-sized side of ice cream and the cheesecake was warm and to die for with berries on top.The drinks are strong but delicious, and many are unique or have a fun spin take on traditional cocktails.The General Manager PJ was very friendly and attentive during our visit, and our waitress was very helpful and attentive as well.Overall this place is a must try! :) Happy eating!Samantha Giacobbe", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ieRkjbk5qWRNZMpnMMeA1w", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Samantha G.", "review_date": "3/15/2017"}, {"review": "We ended up coming to Bottlefork on the whim since our original place of destination was closed.Bottlefork is a small space with a lot to offer.

We also shared the crispy brussel sprouts, which were excellent. I settled for the burger, which was huge and juicy and hard to finish by myself. My wife got the orecchiette pasta. It says on the menu that it comes with spicy chicken sausage, and it turned out to be way too spicy for her. She couldn't eat much of it and got heartburn.

They also had an extensive gin and tonic menu.To share we had: Ensalada LatinaCrispy Brussels SproutsCrispy Bacon BurgerOrecchiette PastaMy cocktail: \"Look Out Below\"Rum, Botran Reserva, Wray & Nephew White Overproof Rum, China China, Passion Fruit, Pineapple, Lime, Angostura-Coconut FoamMy drink was a tropical paradise. I read \"passion fruit\" and \"coconut foam\" in the description and was instantly sold. I also tried my friend's \"Baysic\" cocktail with lemon, vodka, ginger, bay leaf, and banana notes. SO delicious. Definitely not basic.Their burger, we were told, rivals the one at Au Cheval. I didn't think so, but then again I only had 1/4 of the burger that they graciously cut in fourths for us. If I consumed an entire burger, I might have a better point of comparison. I'll save this experiment for next time. Their burger comes with a gigantic pickle and fries.I wish I could've lingered a little longer. Bottlefork's strength is in their meat dishes and their drinks, made to order, quality and fresh ingredients, impeccable flavors. I would've ordered another drink and a few more plates: tots, beef jerky, their charcuterie plate and 'sweet breads.' More meat-based items to tip the scale... and also to hold my drink (:I mentioned earlier in the review that we were in a time crunch. We didn't notify our server at the beginning; I thought we wouldn't need to. \u00a0Turns out our sweet server was pursuing his doctoral degree in music at a prestigious university in the city. We found this out when I requested the check and saw our server's face change from friendly to shocked, almost frustrated.Perhaps my request came off as a little curt and there was an awkward silence, so I followed up with the reason why we were pressed for time; we are heading to a concert. Our predisposition to rush out wasn't a reflection of our experience or his service, which was excellent. So there you go.They have comfy, wide booths for groups or seating at the bar. Their restaurant group is associated with Rockit, Sunda, and the Duck Inn. 4 stars, by really closer to 4.5. It's a quality venue that feels classy and sophisticated without an over-the-top River North vibe.There's a humbleness to Bottlefork that I can't really describe, and they will pleasantly surprise you.

No reservation but we got seated right away around 11 am.I had heard a lot about their Ground Bacon burger, but at $19 I just couldn't pull the trigger. The table next to use got one, and while it looked good, I think 19 bucks is crazy when none of the burger kingpins (Au Cheval, Kuma's, etc...) charge that much. I opted for the skillet french toast while my friend got the Roman Club. French toast was DELICIOUS. It comes out in a skillet and they flip it over on your plate. Pro tip: Don't get the special syrup. It's not worth an extra $2. The dish is sweet enough. My friend's club was good too and it came with a generous portion of fries.Food is really well done here!

I believe it was on Facebook when I first saw the brunch menu and sundaes and bookmarked it. Quite shocked that it took me this long to finally visit considering its walking distance from my flat.My bff and I visited Bottlefork by accident. It was Easter Sunday morning and we had plans to drop by Hub 51 for their buffet. They were packed and the buffet was almost over so we took a stroll and stumbled upon Bottlefork. I was so excited to dine.Upon entry the first thing I noticed was the absolutely stunning mural on the wall. The host was amazing as well. We were immediately sat in a booth at the front across from the bar. Very comfy seating and very beautiful interior decor. Evem menus themselves were beautiful. Props to whomever designed the interior and the menus.Both of us ordered the Wagyu Steak Salad. It was prepared quickly and came out fresh. I loved the flavors. My friend however thought the arugula was a bit too bitter. Even though I loved the salad, I am still trying to find justification for the price point which is why i docked 1 star.

Though it can get soggy, the first few crunchy bites started my palate.Orchiette pasta was delicious, if youre looking for something filling and has a spicy aftermath in each bite. It's definitely something to try out.Roman club came with a side of fries, had an orange spread on the club which gave it some depth. It is on the lighter side. Their cocktail/drink menu has a blueprint depiction of the drug along with the alcohol+ingredients. Love it because the cocktails had playful names and twist to it.

Overall, pleased with the place!They sat us down in a super tiny table for 2 that was super close to the people next to us. As the night progressed, it got louder and louder, which was kind of annoying. Not a fan of restaurants that have that type of seating.We started with the Happy Hour specials. I had the Gin & Tonic Hendricks special for $8 and omg was it strong. Almost too strong for my liking. I asked for simple syrup on the side to help kill some of that taste. I guess you get your money's worth but I like to enjoy my cocktails. My friend got the Brazillian for $10 and was happy with her drinks. Note, we had to ask for the Happy Hour menu and it had 4 Gin mixed drinks on it for $8.For food we got WAY too much. The portions are pretty large. We started with the Tots which were delicious! The pimiento sauce is so good. We then got the Orecchiette pasta which was pleasantly good. A little overwhelming/heavy after a while but the flavors were on point. We also ordered the Fried Chicken which was a huge mistake, mostly because it was HUGE. It's basically an entire chicken fried. It was good but nothing all that mind blowing. Pretty basic fried chicken. The popover biscuit that came with it was so yummy.We ended the night with the Pretzel Caramel Chocolate Sundae/shake thing. SO GOOD. Don't skip it! I didn't care for the beer foam on top but the rest was sooooo good. Def recommend sharing!Overall, good food, decent drinks, and okay ambiance!

\u00a0Oleo sacharum? \u00a0G\u00e9n\u00e9pi des Alpes?? \u00a0If you can tell me what those things are without the aide of Google, round of drinks on this guy.My 'Differences of Character' was a scotch-based drink with allspice dram, honey, lemon, and ghost chile ($14). \u00a0A single giant ice cube occupied most of the space, so I felt a bit scammed on this one. \u00a0No matter, I followed that up with a muy grande order - the 'Blonde on Blonde'. \u00a0Served in a splendid golden metallic pineapple, it was fashioned with Absolute Elyx (their top-of-the-line stuff), rum, white port, champagne, and chile de arbol ($26). \u00a0What made the drink so enjoyable, however, was the design of the vessel itself: the shiny faux fruit could be arranged of 1 of 3 different ways:1) normal, in the upright position (top on the top)2) quirky, with the leaves of the top acting as the base, drink sits inside the curved bottom (top on the bottom, inverted)3) just plain weird, with the bottom of the top acting as the base, drink sits on leaves (top on the bottom, upright)Did you get all that? \u00a0Good. \u00a0Moving on.The food was marked with highs and lows. \u00a0Wagyu jerky ($6) had strong flavors of soy and garlic, tasted like teriyaki, and was great for snacking. \u00a0The Kennebec fries ($6) were drizzled with a malt vinegar aioli, but apart from that weren't too noteworthy. \u00a0From there I ordered scallops (as I often do), and was not at all impressed. \u00a0Although cooked properly, the \"saltimbocca\" aspect of the dish was pretty lame, with the prosciutto almost nonexistent and the sage easily forgotten about. \u00a0For $16, I felt jipped. \u00a0But Bottlefork went and redeemed themselves with the next dish which consisted of...........Grilled octopus & housemade 'Spam' ($21). \u00a0Oh yes. \u00a0This was easily the standout course as well as one of the most unique, best-tasting items I've had in some time. \u00a0Typically, octopus is all rubbery and bleh when I've seen it, but it was seasoned and cooked so well I could barely tell that I was eating a cephalopod. \u00a0The 'Spam' was precisely that, chunks of compressed loaf meat accompanied with Brussels sprout kimchi and sugar snap peas. \u00a0Truly an amazing plate that earned BF a whole heap of points from yours truly.Dessert was thoroughly meh. \u00a0We got a pretzel caramel + fudge sundae ($8) that came topped with a beer stout cream, in lieu of some aerosol can whipped nonsense. \u00a0Served in a tall glass, it was difficult to eat, and apart from the enticing stout \"float\", the rest was forgettable. \u00a0It would've been nice to see a greater variety of sweets besides just ice cream sundaes and peanut butter cheesecake.Our bartender/server was cool, and I noticed the staff re-positioning the bar chairs once people had left. \u00a0Interior was very dim, which makes for an ideal date night, but lousy for picture taking. \u00a0Attractive clientele base too, I like that.OH! \u00a0And I got to chat with the hostess about having Louis XIII de R\u00e9my Martin (aka Louis Trez) as a drink offering. \u00a0Sh*t is crazy expensive, what with the blown crystal decanter and all.....the mere fact that Bottlefork carries this bumps them up a notch.Bread = 4Circuses = 5 (drink presentation included)Although the infamous Billy Dec is the owner, that doesn't mean Bottlefork succumbs to the same awfulness that is the Cubs-fan-and-rat-poop-filled Wrigleyville dump known as Rockit Bar & Grill {{ sidenote: has it really been a year since the health department shut them down? \u00a0My how time flies.... }} \u00a0Quite the contrary, in fact. \u00a0BF is classy and cozy, serving up charismatic cocktails and above-average grub that warrants a return visit.Come for the drinks, stay for the food. \u00a0And fork 'em if they can't take a joke.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rkdE06BbheP4gEhb3ooH0w", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Eric S.", "review_date": "3/22/2016"}, {"review": "I wanted to hate this place.

We were seated quickly by the very friendly host and our waitress followed up soon after. While you go to the Bottlefork for great food, the cocktail list is by far one of the most extensive and interesting in River North (heavy words, I know). They've listed the drinks in order of strength / heaviness. I opted for the \"Not Mescaline Either\" which gave me a great blend of fruity and a dash of spice. The chile liqueur provided a layer that had me ordering \u00a0a second. My date ordered the \"Barrel Pick Old Fashioned\" which was definitely stronger and well blended. Bottlefork doesn't advertise themselves as a shared plate restaurant, but we decided to tackle the menu that way. The highlights of our meal were: \"Bag\" of Crisps + Eggs - if you like salt & vinegar chips, this is a must have! The presentation was unique, as a waiter brought out a poached egg separately and broke it in the bag of chips table side. The egg coating did not stop the chips from being crispy and flavorful. Nashville Style Hot Wings - when ordering this, our waitress warned us that the sauce was made with Ghost pepper. We figured we would be brave and try the wings coated with the sauce anyway, and were these spicy! I could man through one piece, and my boyfriend enjoyed his thoroughly but we did have to order extra water in between. If you have trouble eating spicy food, you must order the sauce on the side or you'll not enjoy this dish at all. Lemongrass Mussels - this was my favorite dish, hands down. The flavors were strong and you can really taste the lemongrass and coconut milk. The basil was a little weak for my preference, but did not hinder my experience. The bread was freshly made, soft interior with a crispy exterior, and not very dense. It was a perfect dish for the cold night!

It's the quintessential Chicago restaurant - heavy on meats, intense on flavors, and balanced cocktails. And its brunch is arguably the best in the city. I have never had an issue getting a reservation here, even when I've called a 1/2 hour before showing up. The host is always gracious, and the staff is friendly, but won't be up in your business. The service can be a little slow sometimes, but overall it's worth it. For brunch, two great items are the 2 Farm Eggs and the Baked french toast. 2 Farm Eggs will ruin you for regular eggs. The eggs are fresh and perfect, and the yolk and jam condiments make a great spread on the toast. As for the Baked French toast, this dish is a Chicago dessert enthusiast's fever dream. Its sweetness is balanced with the tart berry compote and the subtle smokiness from the bourbon maple syrup and the cast iron. Come early to order this, as they have run out of this in the past. And their Bloody Mary? DO ORDER IT. For dinner, as deliciously meat-heavy as the menu is, the salads have been stand-out. They're always fresh and flavorful, and they're a welcome respite from the heaviness of the other dishes. I'm never unsatisfied when I order a salad here.

They don't deserve any stars really.A restaurant needs to try hard to get this kind of rating from me. Me and my buddy came here Tuesday night for 930pm reservations through opentable (1000 point table) which was one of the deciding factors to come here and its decent reviews.As soon as we came in, I mentioned the reservation and this guy looks at his computer screen quickly and seats us. More on this later. We are seated and our waitress comes along and asks us about drinks, etc. Not the most cordial demeanor, but she continued to do small annoying things throughout the evening. She brought us room temperature water in a decanter that would only fill one glass at a time. She never refilled them without being told first. Mind you, this restaurant has a minimal amount of people at this time.We're ready to order and my buddy gets the pasta with chicken sausage and I get the burger and we share the appetizer tots. The burger was cooked as requested (medium rare) \u00a0but I asked for lettuce, onion, and tomato as well. In my experience, usually when you list things out like that, they serve those veggies raw. For some reason, they caramelized the onions. Not what I wanted. Not the end of the world. I'll just scrape the caramelized onions and ask for a side of raw onions. 5 excruciating minutes later it arrives. It should have taken 10 seconds especially when the kitchen was literally behind us. I'll end this quickly now, burger sucked. Bun was a little burned around the edges and the meat itself, although, cooked perfectly on the inside was too charred on the outside and had a charred burned taste at times. Not to mention I bit into a piece of fat while eating it and needed to spit it out.The pasta and tots, however, were worth 4/5 themselves. Oh, and lastly, I received an email from opentable asking me why I didn't fulfill my reservation.

Well-crafted and proper cocktails, cool bartenders whose recommendations were solid, and excellent burgers. Wanting to grab a drink after work, we first walked into Three Dots and a Dash next door. It is probably my mistake thinking I can walk into a popular bar on Friday and enjoy myself, but it was quite an unpleasant scene unless you are looking to get your shoulder bumped by young and rude patrons all night. Instead of getting a second round of drinks, we moved on to Bottlefork. While Bottlefork was also busy, we were lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar. Our plan to grab a drink before dinner turned into:1. Bill Brasky (2.5x drink in terms of size and potency; my favorite of the night - smooth and nicely balanced, with a cool large ice cube slowly melting)2. Differences of Character (Scotch drink with Allspice Dram, with a hint of honey and lemon - surprisingly good for a hot summer night) 3. For the Allocation (A twist on Manhattan, with Genepy and Gran Classico instead of vermouth)4. Smoke of the Day \u00a05. Big Salty Tears (What a nice find! Egg-white smoothing out Sherry and Whiskey, with *disciplined* sage leaf on top)I honestly enjoyed all our drinks, with Bill Brasky and Big Salty Tears being two favorites. Ground Bacon Burger was perfect to soak up the alcohol, and I was happy to try Poutine (with braised beef cheek) south of the Canadian border. Their fries were just okay and could have been crispier. \u00a0 The best part of the Bottlefork is actually the bartenders - Adam and Blaine were our two bartenders, who gave the most on-point recommendations for both drinks and food.

Sure, the carmelized sugar around the edges were a great touch (I mean, it's all done in a skillet) but it just tasted very \"bread-y\" and dry, when I like my French toast to taste soft and moist. Sitting at the bar, we had a great view of the kitchen, and I pin pointed why the French toast had the consistency that it did-- it's a frozen bread package that's dipped in egg and thrown in the skillet. No wonder! Mimosas were average. The Wood Grilled Ground Bacon Burger was also ordered at a table, and that was delicious! In regards to the side dish that is the bacon slab on side, it's quite undercooked and extremely thick. I was surprised that our server didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked.

The atmosphere was nice. I've always loved loud and dimly lit places for some odd reason; it gives you a nice homely feeling and a lively vibe. We got seated near the back of the restaurant and quickly ordered because we were so hungry. My friends and I got wings as appetizers, a burger, pasta, and gnocchi. Surprisingly when our food came the gnocchi was in a really small sized dish, which to me looked like a kid's bowl. It was supposed to be a main dish $16 and I think it's completely fine that fancy restaurants are pricey with small portions but when I glanced at it, it seriously looked like it was half eaten; food on one side and the spoon covered the other which barely had anything there. My only complaint is that it was not presentable at all. My friend was extremely upset by the portion and expressed it to the waiter, who made a joke about it. It wasn't very nice since my friend was clearly upset. He offered Brussels sprouts with it, which I thought was to make up for it but turns out he just suggested it and we had to pay for it. Ok, didn't make things better. My friend decided to speak to the manager, who was extremely nice (and cute!) about the situation and apologetic. He went to speak to the waiter and soon after the waiter came back to apologize (I seriously give him props for that because it's not always easy to apologize). The mood lightened up a bit and the manager came by again (all eyes on him cause did I mention he was cute?!) and offered us hot cheese cake for desserts. It was so nice of him and since I've never tried hot cheese cake, I was super excited!Aside from all of that happening, I actually really like the food. I loved the hot wings, the burger, the pasta (probably my favorite dish), the gnocchi, and the Brussels sprouts! I definitely didn't mind paying for that because to me, the golden rule to food is if you offer delicious, tasty, good quality food the price doesn't matter - I will pay it. If I'm ever in Chicago again I will definitely stop by and try something else.

That's a tiny little lie, we used Yelp to find local spots and we picked this one, mostly due to proximity to where we were and the odd, freezing Chicago evening weather. We'd been Divvy biking for awhile and had built up a huge appetite. It was our attempt to go with the flow and just find somewhere, instead of looking through my lists of recommendations from various people.So, with spontaneity on our side we walked into the BEST last meal in Chicago we could have asked for. It was dim, but it was bustling. I thought there'd be a wait, but there wasn't for a party of two. At first she tried to sit us in a very cramped little two-top, but we asked to try somewhere else. We almost got the 'Chef's Table' bar seats, but sadly we ended up just taking two regular bar seats.As we'd been shuffling about, I'd seen the plate of fried chicken, which essentially meant I was having it. It looked amazing, perfectly battered and fried. Finally seated, we grabbed the menus and went to work. The prices are on the higher side, but as a tourist you get used to it. The vibe is hipster, for sure. They don't even sell soda from the tap, that's how hipster-fancy-cocktail-making they are.Since Yelp helped me find this place, I checked-in on the app and noticed they give you a free appetizer. Who am I to deny anything free? So, I asked the bartender about it and he brought us our \"Bag\" of Crisps and Eggs in less than a few minutes. He had explained it to us, which left us skeptical. Here's how it goes, a brown lunch bag filled with chips that have added vinegar and salt. In a little ramekin is a poached egg, which he swiftly dumped into the bag of chips. Then he shook them violently. The aftermath of random deliciousness in a bowl was pretty amazing, I'm not sure how the flavors blended so well together, but they did. The chips don't really lose their crispness, but the egg 'sauce' adds great flavor. Already winning, and it was free.We didn't order any adult beverages, which seems to be their thing here. We'd been over indulging all trip and I was ready to have a dinner sans alcohol. J did order a soda and sadly the bartender handed him a glass of ice and the mini Pepsi can. The disappointment of an avid soda drinker was evident across his face. His dreams of endless refills were dashed buy this $2 can of 7.5oz of Pepsi.As for dinner, we ordered to entrees and planned on splitting them both, our normal routine. I had to go with the Wood Grilled Ground Bacon Burger and he went for the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. It should be noted, when we walked in the door the sandwich board sign said \"Home of the Famous Bacon Burger,\" I knew I was home ;)If you know the burger situation in Chicago (not that I do), then you know about Au Cheval's burger. Bottlefork's burger is on the same level as theirs, yes I said it. The Bacon Burger's flavor profile is much more complex than Au Cheval's, which is why I say they are in the same category. They both kill it. The flavor of just the burger is amazing. The bun is a heavenly carb bonus. The sauce and other fixings complimented the flavor of everything perfectly. Add some huge crispy fries and dipping sauce, and this is a meal made for a hipster-burger-guzzling patron. They way they plate it is also an added bonus, they use a 'green' (re: hippy) wood fork and put a pickle through it on top of the burger. Taste and plating, they win!Who do they think they are feeding with their Buttermilk Fried Chicken? A table of four? For $24 you get your money's worth. They give you four huge pieces of chicken, battered, seasoned, and fried to perfection. Even the huge chunks of white meat where tender and juicy, no fear of dry chicken with this kitchen. We both didn't like the gravy, it had a very strong mustard flavor, mixed with a small hint of vinegar. It just wasn't our thing, but I'm sure you may enjoy it. The griddled biscuit that accompanies this dish, was a huge disk of confusion for taste buds. It was savory, but pancake-esque, but still also like a biscuit. I think after a few bites, we finally gave in to liking it. We probably didn't talk for a good 20 minutes, while we stuffed our faces of this delicious meal.I have so much more to try on this menu, but sadly it will have to wait until I'm back in the Windy City. The desserts looked tempting, but we already had our sights on stopping one more place after dinner, so we passed. The bartenders/servers were awesome, no complaints about anything, really.

If you want to experience that first hand you should check out Naha, Vera or Ruxbin. This place was different. The manager, Scott, seated us and chatted us up a bit to get a feel for what we were in the mood for. The same with our server, Eddie. They made some pretty spot-on recommendations. Scott nailed the drink recos. Once he realized I'm a bourbon guy he brought out a taste of one he recommended. I'm annoyed I can't remember the name of it because I'm somewhat spacey at times. Anyway, he hit the nail on the head and I'll be back to find out what exactly it was. Here's the deal...the service was frickin' awesome.Just some stuff:It just wouldn't be me if I didn't give a little friendly critique so here goes. If you don't eat red meat the menu is probably a bit limited, but still doable. And if you're on a budget and you like to imbibe you should be careful because your tab could get out of hand quickly. The space is somewhat small, but I like intimate so it works for me.This place is the real deal.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=m-OmAgKju0VPlgGlIZim1w", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Chad R.", "review_date": "12/15/2016"}, {"review": "Incredibly fresh burger with killer sauce and fantastic fries.

We were promptly sat and some of us ordered cocktails and the others got a bottle of wine. We also put in the order for our food at same time, about 7 share plates. Cocktails arrived still waiting on wine. Then the dishes came out one by one. We probably had 4 dishes already and still no wine. Clearly picking up the forks way before the bottle here. They told us they didn't have any chilled bottles and it would be a min. Dishes 5-6 arrived and finally they decided to bring over 2 chilled glasses to compensate for the wait. But wine would be coming soon. We then only had one dish left and wine bottle was still not here, so we opted to cancel because at this point no one wanted to chug down a full bottle with the dinner over...they didn't seem too pleased that we canceled the bottle, but come on...this was on you. Why didn't you just tell us from the get go that this wine wasn't ready? We could have ordered another one...As for food...underwhelming. The mussels and lamb ribs were our last two dishes and we were very excited for them since we wanted to end meal on high note. Mussels down right fishy. So unpleasant. And the lamb was tough, and just a bit too gamey, and fatty. Not good. The best part were the truffle chips, which was the cheapest item we ordered. Seems like they need to pay much more emphasis to the higher quality ingredients than on the junk food. Gnocchi was mediocre, Brussels sprouts very salty, meatball flatbread held its own and was pretty good, but spicier than expected since no indication of that on menu...We opted out of dessert because it wasn't worth risking any more $$ on food that just may continue to be lackluster.The redeeming notes were that the cocktails were very good and they comped some money off the bill, which was a good courtesy given this underwhelming experience.

In addition to the crisps, I enjoyed the Big Salty Tears, a drink that was not salty at all and not sweet either despite the use of two sherries.

It even has a crappy, uninspired name that's trying to be just like all the other \"New American Hipster\" garbage dumps that pass for restaurants popping-up all over trendy Chicago areas. How much did you pay someone to come up with the words \"bottle\" and \"fork\" placed together?Hyperbole abounds here. Quotation marks on the menu items to make things seem better than they are. Those are still frozen square tater tots in melted Velveeta you just ordered on the side. That bag of chips with an egg gimmick is gross. The presentation looks hideous. Actually, most items here incorporate egg. Your server will rave about the Bloody Mary....which is the worst you'll probably ever have. Seeds and clumps of black pepper are all your straw picks up.

Awesome, me neither!A nest of fried shoestring onions tops your burger and pretty much destroys any taste of bacon, hamburger, or \"special sauce.\" Oh, and your $16 medium-well burger will have pink, underdone spots, too.

I did feel like it took quite a while to get our food out, but they warmed us up with nice hot alcoholic drinks (they'll make hot drinks for you off menu if you ask!) more than made up for it. Prices seemed reasonable. I ordered the poutine with the beef brisket, which I honestly thought was pretty meh, but I still haven't found great poutine outside of Canada so probably my fault for ordering it. The gravy was pretty bland and the cheese wasn't exactly curd, and both were pretty scarce. The pork loin dish is honestly terrible. It's a giant hunk of pork, but they somehow ruined it by covering it in a very bitter, very salty sauteed kale-like green that just did not go well with the dish at all. We ended up scraping all of it off to the side, and even then everything had a slight bitter tinge. Not a fan.Come here for the drinks!

If my entire meal consisted of only a ginormous plate of brussel sprouts, I'd be okay with that. I'm not always a huge fan of these hard-to-cook and hard-to-season veggies, but whatever the chefs do here, they do it more than very well. Sprouts were crispy, grilled, and seasoned with maple-bourbon vinaigrette. Wow, just wow. But that's not the only wow about this place. There is so much more...I had the pleasure of coming here with a large group of colleagues and a menu made special just for us. The space is long and narrow, but they managed our reservation and seating requirements without a hitch. We had a group of 11, and it was no problem making room for us in the back. I actually enjoyed the intimacy and atmosphere quite a bit. First Course - BitesOur meal consisted of a variety of different course offerings starting with smoked olives. I am a huge olive fan to begin with, so add a hint of orange and coriander and you'll no doubt appreciate the delicacy. Check-in to the restaurant on your Yelp app and you'll enjoy the potato chips with a poached egg all shaken up in a bag. Yeah, they are a bit slimy in consistency, but the flavor of vinegar and sea salt mixed in is explosive. Not like I've ever had before. Our charcuterie plate was lovely. The mini bread loaves attached together like monkey bread, were hot and fresh. 2nd Course - Salads/GreensYou already know how I feel about the brussel sprouts. The Ensalada Latina salad, though completely packed with a wonderful variety of fresh ingredients, was a bit too spicey for my mild palate (Corn & Black Bean Relish + Butternut Squash Cotija Cheese + Masa Croutons Tomatillo Vinaigrette). I enjoyed the Meditteranean Salad (Eggplant Hummus + Olives + \"Saganaki\" Cheese Sumac Croutons), but it's quite filling. I had to stop because I wanted to save room for the main course.Main CourseThe cider braised pork belly served on a sweet potato pur\u00e9e, melted in my mouth. It was soft and flavorful, and mixed in well with the sweet potato. I wish I would have taken more servings of this. Though my colleagues weren't super into the potato gnocchi with mushroom broth and fried pickled mushrooms, I enjoyed the feeling of the fresh soft dumplings mixed with a mushroom crunch. I'm still not a huge fan of goat cheese, so I could have done without that. I have a soy allergy, and so I was advised to stay away from the grilled octopus. Sadly I enjoy grilled octopus. I am often bored by rotisserie chicken, but here it's moist and well seasoned and fell off the bone when cutting it. Now that's the way chicken should be. Also note, the veggies had a lovely crunch to them. Not over cooked.DessertCheers to the homemade creamy soft serve ice cream with the side of apple, caramel and sweet cream custard. Besides being gorgeous in it's presentation, the custard was so ooey gooey yummy and rich. Overall, the service here was 5+ stars. Our server, in particular, did an amazing job of looking after my soy allergy and gave me the heads up when there was something I should stay away from. I'm am so appreciative. I have no doubt the lunch and brunch are a hit. The music was a tad loud that night, the lighting just a hint too dark (only a hint), and I can only imagine the challenge they must have getting people in and out of there quickly. It's small with only a few tables, and there was a group of people waiting when I left. It gets crowed quickly. It's pricey here, which is why I can only give it four stars. It's not a place I could frequent on a regular basis.

My expectations for the food were pretty high, but I had heard the service was not great. The waitress was friendly and generally helpful, but she consistently only refilled one of our coffees (there were 3) and sort of laughed and rolled her eyes when we asked if they had any almond milk (I don't blame her, but at least wait until you leave the table). We ordered the Bag of Buttermilk & Vanilla Bean Doughnut Holes as an appetizer, and didn't find them to be anything extraordinary. They were a nice, fluffy texture and served hot, but I didn't taste any vanilla bean (or any other flavor for that matter). I thought they could have used a bit more cinnamon sugar, although I'm used to New Orleans beignets which probably have too much sugar for most people.The two other people in my party had the Corned Beef Brisket Hash, which they said was pretty good. I had the Greek Omelet which was largely flavorless. It had a generous amount of tzatziki on top, and was served with spinach, tomato, and feta, but somehow the only thing I could taste was the eggs.

French. Toast. Ever. Ok I may be exaggerating a little bit, but kinda not really. Bottlefork went above my expectations today. It's a decent sized space (not large by any means though) and had an intimate, speakeasy-ish feel. I think we had good timing as we were seated right away by the friendly host. Brunch menu is a bit limited which is one of the reasons why I docked a star, but what they lack in quantity they make-up in quality. Let me tell you about this french toast. I'm not usually a fan of french toast either but it jumped out to me off the menu so I decided why not? First, it's made in a mini cast-iron skillet. The waitress loosens up the 5 chunks of french bread and flips it over onto the serving board and up wafts this warm smell of sugary/buttery goodness that is revealed, dripping down over the bread, accompanied by a side of sweet cream and blueberry compote. Very hot, fresh and surprisingly not too sweet. (You don't need the optional maple syrup). My dad tried some and he said he would definitely like to eat the whole thing and kept eyeing my food after that. Even the woman at the table next to us said \"I'm sorry, I just have to admire what you got!\". Needless to say, every last bit (even cream and compote) was eaten. Now my huckleberry lemon-aid is another story. Sounded awesome on paper but disappointing in person. It was overly sour and I couldn't really taste much huckleberry. I added 2 packets of truvia to make it more palatable. This is other reason for docking a star. I want my 7 dollars back. My mother got the corned beef brisket hash which was also a hit. The little I sampled was definitely really delicious. Dad's ground bacon burger was good too but nothing exceptional. He also really liked their coffee. Overall, a really enjoyable Sunday brunch.

One of the best service experiences I've had. As mentioned earlier, they let us in 10 min before opening so we didn't have to wait in the cold. Our waitress engaged in conversation with us and had no problem answering all the questions we had. We had told her about our plans to go clubbing at Underground, which turned out to be their sister company! As a result, the manager came over, gave us his card and informed us on how to get on the guest list for the club (free entrance, yayyy!). We ended up coming back later that night to pre-game and the bartenders were super chill, making jokes and having conversation. Ambiance: Dimly lit place.

Something about the malt vinegar powder, sea salt, and the egg makes the combination of flavors amazing with the chips.The tuna crudo with avocado and shrimp cracklin' was one of our favorite dishes for brunch. It was the perfect mix of raw tuna, avocado and the crispy shrimp stuff on top. If I were to make a poor man's version of it, I'd probably top it with that Asian snack, shrimp crackers. It went really well over the bread they gave us.We got the warm ceasar salad afterwards, which had this grilled cheese thingy on top. I particularly loved the warm, roasted tomatoes with it. I think the cheese a little much, but I just cut a few small pieces according to how much I wanted with each bite.Last but not least, we had the pumpkin donut holes, which were nice and dense and how I like my donuts.

My first mistake was making a reservation to come on a Friday night as I'd forgotten that I'd rather be in hell than in River North on a weekend night. Not my people. Not my scene. Just nicht f\u00fcr mich all around. I'd made reservations for 2 people at 9pm and received not only a confirmation email but also two phone calls to confirm my 9pm reservation and make sure I knew their policy that my reso is only good for an hour and a half dining experience so they can accommodate all their reservations. I wasn't planning on stretching my meal into a multi-hour-long event, but I also wasn't a huge fan of the pre-game warning about my meal being limited to an hour and a half, especially when their hours note that they close at 11pm... I guess I was just lucky to not be the person with the 10:30 reservation getting a 30-minute dining time-limit warning. I was also a bit put off when I did show up just shy of 9pm for my confirmed reservation and was told that my table wasn't ready and likely wouldn't be for 15 more minutes (which actually ended up being 30 minutes), but that we could try to fight our way through the gauntlet of tragically hip, freshly 20-somethings to attempt to get a drink at the bar or wait outside on the street. We chose the street.After our extended 30-minute wait, we were sat at a tiny 2-seat table across from the host stand which was probably as decent a seat as any, since the noise level throughout was downright deafening. I know it's cool to have loud music and all, but if everyone in the restaurant has to scream or get right up in your ear, it's maybe something to rethink. \u00a0I will say that all 4 of the cocktails my guest and I had were phenomenal, though half of them seemed to either have a bit too short of a pour or needed to be more fitting glassware. I would still recommend all of them ('Little Miss Dynamite', 'No Tea, No Shade', 'Big Salty Tears', 'Loft on Broadway') to anyone willing to part with $14 for a finely crafted cocktail.As far as food goes, I should have done my research. I didn't realize that there were virtually no dishes on the menu that are vegetarian/pescetarian friendly and that's my fault. I was super bummed to find out that the main dish I'd booked my reservation around, the creamed kale with duck egg, had boar bacon in it (which does totally sound delicious) and the creamed kale is pre-mixed with the bacon in it and unable to be served without. But again, that's my fault completely for reserving my table based on a pretty picture and incomplete dish description.The server suggest 2-3 dishes per couple so we lightly followed her advice and got the following:** \"Bag\" of Crisps and Eggs - $5 - which was actually free with Yelp check-in and my favorite dish of the night. If I came back for cocktails I'd have no bones about ordering this again.** Mediterranean Salad with Olives, Eggplant Hummus, \"Saganaki\" Cheese, Sumac Croutons - $16 - It was good, but nothing to fawn over. ** Grilled Octopus & Housemade Spam with Brussels Sprout \"Kim Chee\" + Sugar Snap Peas - $21 - We got ours without the spam, which I appreciated them accommodating, but this is one dish I wouldn't recommend altering. It's highly acidic and the vinegar is overpowering to point of stinging if you don't have the buttery bites of Babe mixed in to off-set. ** Walleye special - $22 - I didn't realize that walleye is a largely flavorless fish and the menu description made it seem like it was going to be much more interesting than it was. The plating was beautiful, even in Bottlefork's darkest of dark settings, but beyond that the dish fell flat flavor-wise.** Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler - It looked stunning, but it tasted about as tart as it could be before hitting the wall on inedible. I'm no good at balancing flavors so I have no constructive suggestions, but I def needed to chug my beverage after each bite to wash the pucker out of my mouth. In the end, our bill was actually really reasonable for what I was expecting and I did love having several of our dishes served by Chef Kevin Hickey, as he just looks like a dude I would hang out with and his smile is certainly contagious. Unfortunately, our dining experience was (more than a bit) marred by the mixed company of freshly-turned-20-somethigns dressed in whatevers trendy at that hour, attempting to shout above the vociferous volume of the dining room about their impending divorce and/or how they cleverly escaped DUI charges while the food just didn't rest as remarkable and certainly didn't inspire me to even want to attempt to push that hour-and-a-half dining time limit the hostess had warned about.

Our server (forgot his name; longer hair, beard) was honestly THE most passionate server I've ever had. He knew the menu inside and out, intricately describing every dish he recommended. He made sure we were well taken care of. As for the sustenance, the Bloody Mary was basically an appetizer. The house blended mix, carefully selected vodka, and intricate skewer were amazing. Not to mention affordable, and a large portion! We only needed to have one apiece. Our Yelp Check-In free crisps app was an interesting twist on boring potato chips - loved the poached egg tossed in as well as the presentation! I ordered the burger.
