I had the chicken teriyaki bowl. It was tasty, no complaints. We also shared the edamame dumplings, which were also good. On the inside, the place is gorgeous. High ceilings and lots of natural light; aesthetically, the place is stunning. It's a great ambiance for a date night or a group dinner. Be warned, it's noisy in here so if you go in a group, you'll likely be chatting with only the people immediately next to you. Oh, and it gets very busy despite the fact that it's a large place, so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. Otherwise, you'll be sitting in the bar area. My only complaint is that the food is pricey and the portions aren't exactly big for what you're paying.

It was VERY busy so I'd say book a table in advance. Service was excellent, very friendly waiter who made menu recommendations and was playful to our little toddler. They didn't have enough highchairs which wasn't ideal but we managed. Food was delicious. We had the beef tacos, mushroom pizza and the margherita pizza from the kids menu and two skinny margarita cocktails which were yummy. Price is on the high side however.

Am I the only one that feels proud when making responsible, healthy meal decisions in a city filled with indulgent comfort food? I know I'm not. The good news is, at True Food Kitchen, you can feel good about what you eat, without suffering through a flavorless meal that reminds you through every bite that adulting is hard. And if you happen to be having a day where you feel like adulting is extra hard, feel good knowing that True Food also offers a fresh and fruity cocktail menu as well.When we dropped by for lunch on a weekday, the place was packed, so make sure to make reservations. Once seated, we were able to order quickly, with the food coming out even more quickly. I ordered the Butternut Squash Pizza with smoked onion, organic kale, vegan almond ricotta, dried cranberry. The pizza was outstanding, and easy to share with a group. If you're ordering only for yourself, it will be more than enough and you'll probably need to take some home, so sharing is a great option. I also ordered the Seared Albacore Tuna salad, with \u00a0avocado, grapefruit, cabbage, cashew, watermelon radish, thai basil, sesame, chili garlic dressing. It was one of the beautiful and one of the best salads I've had in awhile. In fact, although full there was no way I was leaving my leftovers behind. Overall, loved the natural light and simplistic aesthetic of the restaurant and everything that our entire group ordered seemed to have been enjoyed.

Went here with a group and tried lots of dishes. We started with kale guac, which I'd say was good but fairly standard. We also tried the cauliflower (delicious!!) and edamame dumplings (amazing - so soft). Then we got the squash pizza, which was probably my favorite - baked to perfection and topped with the perfect cheese (if I remember correctly I think it was ricotta). We decided to add another dish - some sort of bowl plus steak (it had quinoa) - after feeling like we could eat a bit more, and that one became my new favorite LOL.Ended with two desserts - chia seed pudding and apple crisp. Both good but not must-haves, in my opinion.

I agree with the reviews that state that you can leave here and NOT feel crappy from what you ate. I didn't realize this was a chain and haven't been to any of the other locations. The space is mostly bright, spacious, and so open! Initially, I thought the front room was the entire restaurant, but there's a whole other section in the back right next to the open kitchen! \u00a0The first time I went, we had reservations and were seated within 10 minutes. The second time I went, we walked in and were quoted 25-30 minutes and they texted as soon as the table was available. That second time I went, I was following the whole 30 eating plan and was able to make my food whole 30 compliant, which was AWESOME (and hard to accomplish at many restaurants). That time around, I had one of the salads and asked to modify it a bit. The waiter was extremely accommodating!Other items we have ordered include:+ Kale guacamole - delicious! I asked for veggies to dip into the guac and they brought a dish of crudite out.+ Edamame dumplings - REALLY good - the white truffle oil is a nice touch and the small amount of broth they come in is delicious. + Charred Cauliflower - the contrast of the harissa and the dates really worked for this app! so good!+ Butternut squash pizza - basically got this because we wanted to try the vegan almond ricotta, but REALLY enjoyed the entire pizza! Kind of oily at the bottom, but overall SO good (do you see a trend??) + Inside Out Quinoa burger - ordered this as my entree and loved it AND the hash that came with it! The quinoa patties were actually a bit dry, but otherwise the dish was fine.+ Spaghetti Squash Casserole - my friend ordered this and I had a bite. The sauce was pretty tasty, but it was insanely cheesy (which I usually wouldn't complain about, but if you're trying to make the dish healthier with spaghetti squash, the cheese is counteracting that effort)+ Spicy Panang Curry - another friend ordered this - I didn't try it. She said it was VERY good, just VERY spicy for her. She ended up asking for extra rice since she went through her portion quickly while trying to bring the spice level down a bit.For drinks, I tried the War of the Roses cocktail (special Valentines week menu) and the Farmer's Market Sangria- both were great.Overall, I loved this place.

In general, the concept that the restaurant offer is amazing! Everything in the restaurant is seasonal, fresh, and so delicious!

Having dined at locations in Arizona and California, I have been counting down for its November opening. True to form, the meal did not disappoint. The Fall menu is filled with good eats for every palate. Hummus - 4/5; great toppers and available with gluten free pita upon request. We also ordered a side of vegetable crudites. Medicine Man - 4/5; a tasty combination of antioxidants. Think berry flavored. Honey Lemonade - 3/5; refreshing but not a favorite. Would likely try something different the next time around. Scottish Steelhead \"Salmon\" - 4/5; it is trout that looks and taste like salmon. The smoked quinoa was the star on the plate. Ah-mazing. Highly recommend it. ($24) Spaghetti Squash Casserole - 5/5; of course I added a protein, namely chicken sausage to this delectable dish. It is my go to every visit because it is healthier, hearty option packed with flavor. \u00a0Squash pie with GF graham cracker crust- (vegan free too) 5/5; the reason I visited in Fall on a 24 degree weather day.Our total (appetizer, two entrees, two nine ounce glasses of wine - Pinot Noir & Rhone blend, two desserts and two refreshing non alcoholic drinks) was $131 before gratuity. ... ***********Also most appreciative of our server Gina for asking a manager for new seating when we asked for a place \u00a0away from the entrance.

The TFK restaurants I've been to in California offer the most bountiful beautiful inspiring bowl of crudit\u00e9s-- so much so that I remember and look forward to returning whenever I'm in LA. It's $14 for a large and $9 for a small, but it's always been worth it. For this reason, I was excited to hear they were opening in Chicago. \u00a0Upon arrival, I ordered the crudit\u00e9s--excited--and the meal stopped there. What arrived was a bowl of ice cubes with a with a few stray vegetables on top. It felt like I was so late to the wedding, I'd missed the hors d'oevres. \u00a0Take a look at the pictures below. Did someone drop broccoli on the ice sculpture? More important: Did my memory deceive me? I texted my LA sister a picture to ask if I'd lost my mind; she insisted there had to be a mistake. I searched the Internet for images only to find validation. So I asked my waitress who called Iver the manager. The manager's reply? \u00a0She told me she plans speak to corporate because plainly some stores are not adhering to corporate standards!!! I pleaded with her not to do so--did she have to ruin it for everyone? She had no answer for the plethora of similarly adoring images all over the Internet other than to repeat that she intended to speak to corporate. Brilliant. Give that woman a raise. She offered a refund, but I don't want freebies. I want a beautiful, lovely, bountiful, inspiringly arranged bowl of mouthwatering veggies and a reason to return in the future with friends who will be similarly enthralled with a unique find. But I can't do that because for $9-14, I think it's fair to say the portion was microscopic (maybe Produce at Whole Foods was on strike?) and the uninspired crudit\u00e9s \u00a0aesthetic enough to give me a chemical depression.

I came here extremely excited since I've been to true foods in Arizona and loved it!! Needless to say when true foods showed up in chicago I was very happy! It had been a while since I had their food so I looked up a few reviews for items to order for carry out. Verdict below. Matcha horchata 3.5/5 - a little too sweet but some may like it this way. It could do with more concentrated matcha flavor and less milk. I probably won't order this again.Steak tacos 5/5 - really enjoyed this dish but the portion size was so small - think kid size :( I think three tacos would have been perfect but it only comes with two and a very modest size of steak. The ingredients tastes fresh and well put together! (Even for carry out!) Kale salad (1/5) - okay I love kale salad but this was completely inedible. The salad was over salted and had too much vinegar/ dressing. I took 1.5 bites and couldn't finish the rest. So sad. I asked my husband to try it and he said it's the kind of food you take one bite and have to walk away for 15 minutes to reset your palette. What?! Who eats like that?? Miserable. I love the kale salad at Siena Tavern and this was such a departure from any kind of kale salad I ever had. I was upset this food was wasted because I couldn't even swallow another bite of it. \u00a0 The food is pretty expensive so I was disappointed that this was not the quality I expected for the value.I want to come back for brunch on the weekend and try some other dishes like ancient grains.

Being able to go out to eat and not feeling terrible the next day about the food choices you made at dinner...a great feeling! They offer very healthy choices that are a unique blend of flavors and ingredients, but still very delicious. As soon as we walked in, I noticed how spacious the restaurant was. When we immediately walked in, they have a small herb garden. Half the restaurant is bright and well light, and the other half is slightly dimmer. All the food we had was delicious and I can't wait to be back to try more items on the menu (I love that 80% of the menu is vegetarian friendly). Veggie Crudite: 3/5 - essentially just organic vegetables, but only reason I loved this dish was because of the black olive dip (I usually hate olives, but this dip was delicious). Next time, I'd see if I could just get the dip, cause without it, it is essentially just vegetables on ice. Edamame Dumplings: 5/5 - These were delicious! They were light and flavorful. Charred cauliflower: 5/5 - I really liked these! Very flavorful, cauliflower was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Brussel sprout and wild mushroom pizza: 3/5 - I really liked the pizza; the only reason I took off a couple stars is because it didn't seem like a very unique dish. It tasted pretty standard and there weren't many brussel sprouts on our pizza. Spaghetti squash casserole: 3/5 - This is probably the only dish I wouldn't reorder or want to reorder. It was definitely a healthier alternative to pasta noodles, however in comparison to the other dishes it didn't taste as flavorful. Ancient Grains Bowl w/Tofu: 5/5 - The sweet potato with the teriyaki sauce was BOMB DOT COM! It was really flavorful with their homemade teriyaki sauce, the sweet potatoes were so soft it's like they melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were so well cooked and flavored; it went perfect with the green sauce. I wish they offered this as takeout so I could take it for lunch. The flourless chocolate cake was so yummy (I love chocolate so I may be biased). I will definitely be ordering this next time I'm there - you can also pick the flavor of the ice cream they serve with the cake.

Great selection of drinks had the Medicine man, great palate washer. Not too sweet with a hint of pomegranate. \u00a0The Honey bee ginger beer was teeming with ginger flavor and zest.Ordered the Butternut squash pizza as an appetizer. Indescribable! The flavors...the smokiness...the crisp on the outside crust done just right...the vegan almond ricotta... the onions....ohhhhhhh my! This is a definite MUST try! Onto our main dishes. We split two different dishes.The Ancient grains bowl...ohhhhhhh boy! The deliciousness of the miso glazed sweet potatoes, can I have just a plate of those please...what a combination of flavors this dish had. The sweetness of the miso glaze, mixed with a bit of heat, the crunching of the snow peas, the smokiness of the charred onions, mixed in with the avocado, and grains left our tongues tickled with flavor. The other plate we had was the TLT with sweet potato hash. The TLT bread had just the right amount of sweetness, toasted with just the right amount of crunch. The tempeh had a great smoked flavor,and the sandwich was stacked with butter lettuce, ripe tomatoes, avocado and vegan mayo. I have been looking for a good TLT sandwich for a while, this one hit the spot! And the sweet potato hash... with smoked onions... so good. Sweet potatoes were diced so there was no overpowering sweetness from the potatoes, just the right amount of salt made this an excellent choice for a side.We had room for dessert and ordered the Butternut squash pie with the matcha horchata. I am not a fan of matcha nor horchata but this drink made me one! The Butternut squash pie was the perfect ending to our meal. It sounds odd but was so good. A pretty decent sized slice too, topped with coconut whipped cream this was thoroughly enjoyed!My son was not big on eating vegan/vegetarian because most of the foods lack in flavor (according to him) this restaurant made a believer out of him.

Seriously, it took them over a year to put up the building and build out the restaurant which is insanely slow. Now, having been there twice, I don't think I'll return. The food is... okay I guess? That's \u00a0about as much as I can muster. So far we've tried the guacamole, edamame dumplings, Asian bowl, turkey burger, lasagna and chocolate cake. Edamame dumplings are a stand out. Definitely delicious. Turkey burger was REALLY dry and bland. I also requested a GF bun which was a $2.50 upcharge. Not that big of a deal but our server didn't mention it when ordering or when she dropped off the bill. Lasagne bolognese might be the saltiest dish that I've ever had at a restaurant. My face puckered when at the first bite and I only had a few bites in total. That was enough though as my partner and I couldn't sleep later in the night because we had stomach cramps. We both eat really healthy and don't have any digestive issues, so I'm not 100% sold on the health claims of the menu.The other issue is the servers. The staff is really nice and seems to be trying their best, but both of our servers just seemed over their head. They would forget items and didn't seem to understand the menu. I don't actually feel that it's their fault, though. The restaurant drops off a pamphlet about non-imflammatory diets and they seem to think that substitutes staff training.

And neither of us was disappointed. Yes, it's a gluten free pasta, but I didn't miss the gluten at all. Nor did I miss the pork, as the chicken sausage was perfect in this dish. It was absolutely delicious. The only thing missing was a piece of bread to help sop up the remaining bit of the sauce. But perhaps that would mess up the gluten-freeness of the entree.

Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu as well. \u00a0The service was great too. \u00a0Also a majority of their desserts are vegan - \u00a0I had the butternut squash pie with coconut cream, \u00a0which is divine!", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating"}, {"review_date": "1/22/2017", "user_name": "PJ B.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=efhUeH_NCWAm5SAF3D3L6w", "review": "This place is a great addition to Chicago's vegan/vegetarian restaurants.

I work too hard for my money and I'm smart enough to use Zagat for premier local establishments. Here's why you should, too. I've never written a review like this, but I'm tired of corporate shams and I think most consumers are, too. Since most of the public reviews for this place seem to be paid for by their private equity firm (the manager told me it's owned by one), I'm going to review them here. I'm also a nutritionist with an MBA, so naturally, I had to try this place when I saw it. The space, with the wood accents and smart design, beckoned me to try it, too. Make no mistake: this is a mass consumer chain that imitates and insults real cooking and dining, and here's why:The variety should alarm you. The menu is a messy \"jack of all trades,\" which should arouse suspicion. Chicken, fish, streak, burgers, pizza, pasta, Japanese (Teriyaki), Mediterranean (Hummus), Chinese (Dumplings), Thai (Curry), to name a few of their regional dishes, and none are unique or noteworthy, though their ingredients are okay--I was told it's roughly 40% organic by the staff. For me, in the end, the experience made me feel as though I would've been better suited at a restaurant with a more definitive focus, like a Thai restaurant if I wanted curry; a Japanese restaurant if I wanted teriyaki; or a real pizza place if I wanted pizza--did I mention that their lifeless pizza sucks? Where's the flavor? As for the experience, we sat at the bar. I noticed that the pom chia limeade is made from concentrate. I saw the commercial jug they had bought from a purveyor in the fridge, and I watched the bartender mix a large batch with water. I assume the lemonade is the same. The lemons and limes in the fruit display are only for show. Some of the other fruits might be, too. Bartender splashed less than .5 oz of pomegranate juice in the limeade for color. The juice was regular Pom from the store. In fact, I never saw a pomegranate anywhere. The pom seeds in the medicine man came out of a pre-peeled, pomegranate seed package, which was also pulled from the fridge. Was surprised. Wife tried the Kale aid, which was okay but celery heavy. Also wasn't made to order. Bartender poured it from a jug, which was disconcerting because vitamins in fresh squeezed juice dissipate when they're not in a vacuum. Less than 15 minutes is the typical threshold. Bartender seemed confused when I told her, smiled, and went about her business. Also noticed that the apple soda and carrot tonic use less than 1 oz of juice apiece. It's mostly soda water and an intelligent layering of splashes. Smart bankers. The menu description makes them sound so delicious, but I wish you could see how they're made. After we ordered, the appetizers arrived in less than 5 minutes, which would normally make me ecstatic, but I wondered if any cooking had been done so I ventured toward their open kitchen. I saw par-cooked chicken sitting on cold sheet trays, and I saw piles of pre-cooked vegetables waiting to be reheated on sheet trays, too. The chicken on the chicken salad comes from a portioning bag that's pulled from a fridge. The Albacore Tuna was the same way. I saw \"chefs\" pull pre-seared, pre-cooked tuna from portioning bags, from the fridge, before they layered garnishes over the segments. They were presliced, too, in the interest of time. The quinoa burger patties were pre-cooked, too. They were sitting, cold, on sheet trays waiting to be reheated. Tofu was pre-cooked too, sitting in a pan in the salamander, waiting hot, til' someone ordered a piece. With all of this being said, it's probably safe to assume that the daily market soup is anything but daily, too.Conclusion? The plates look far more attractive in writing than in person. Miso glazed sweet potato sounds exciting, but the execution is anything but that. You must remember, the people doing the cooking here are working near minimum wage--these are mostly new industry workers seeking steady pay and kitchen experience that reputable establishments would never offer. It's a clever gimmick indeed, but I'm sad to say that this gimmick is better suited for consumers that are expanding their tastes from the likes of taco bell and dominos--this class will be most compelled by the experience. As for the rest, if you've ever seen the inside of Whole Foods, or any of the products they commonly sell, you'd know that this is too sophomoric for you.I should also note that I was harassed by the business owner and managers for posting this review.
