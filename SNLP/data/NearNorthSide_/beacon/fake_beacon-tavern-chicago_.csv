"This place is a total ripoff.  $42 filet mignon comes in 4 small slices brisket style (for Chicago that is McDonalds quality), which may have been 4 oz. tops.  I went there to avoid chains in the river north area.  You're better off with Morton's and McCormick and Schmick's.  I just had a shrimp cocktail at the Langham nearby that was larger in size than my dinner.  This was the late night menu.  Beacon, get a clue or go out of business.","11/3/2016","1.0 star rating","ILC0TAbnbQAj-Zwm1GczRQ","Michael B."

"I went here today with my family hoping for a good meal (we are all very picky vegetarians/pescatarians), and boy was it delicious. We started out with the cheddar biscuits which were flaky and rich. We then all ordered entrees. I got the vegetable stew, which was so good! Someone in our group also got the fish and chips, which was good, but not quite as good as the fish and chips over in Europe. My father ordered the tuna tartare, which he said was good too. All the beer was on tap, but being underage I tried one of the soft cocktails (the orange blossom one i think) and was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit bitter but had a really good flavor. We looked at the dessert menu, but in the end decided to grab Molly's Cupcakes (another great Chicago restaurant). I'm sure the desserts were lovely though. It was a little pricey, but the ambiance was good and the service was ok. The service was great in the beginning, but towards the end we had some trouble finding our waiter. I would definitely visit again.","2/25/2017","4.0 star rating","nhh1QaIOIjvEmQTUsP7B_w","A S."
"&#34; Â this dish allowed the pasta to soak up twice as much of the sauce which made all the difference; an ingenious move for such a tasty and light sauce! Â i must say that none of the dishes were salty.service was impeccable; and now my server's name escapes me; but he was great.lobster bucatini will always be my go-to dish at beacon tavern.yum.i want to come back for the beacon ice cream bar!!.the pistachio mousse with layered almond cake and strawberry filling was excellent and light; love the texture of the crumble and the cold quenelles sorbet.but not here.did not love that.really greatblue prawns-this dish was just ok in comparison to the amazing shrimp toast we had just devored.we walked over to dinner and had a little trouble finding the place.","11/9/2016","4.0 star rating","RWVsBnE1SYvyTjYuvSBvFQ","Adrian M."
"We stumbled on this place last WEEK. For a simple brunch and we enjoyed everything we've tried.  Do try their Uncle Eric's Roadhouse Burger and it's really good. Mouthwatering! Your tum was easily full. Beacon Tavern Punch was very refreshing. Their desserts will also satisfy your tooth. Maybe a quite pricey, but I tell you it's worth it. Want to go back. Would need a couple more visits to be able to try everything here.","8/7/2016","4.0 star rating","Q3DIvyoUWJc_gP5FdY0D6g","Tammy S."

"I am from St George, Utah looking for a great restaurant with two business friends and found it in the Beacon.  The venue, service staff, fantastic food choices and refreshments made it a memorable event for all of us.  Location is hard to find, but it has that exclusive venue effect,  We recommend to all people who like nothing but the best of the above.We will never forget our fantastic choice and the people who ate and drank around us cause it is a real friendly place in the bar area.  More privacy can be found in the rear, but we like eating, drinking with the ""bar action""!!!!St George will never be the same!!!!!","11/16/2016","5.0 star rating","np2phImTpZPbIlNUThsVGg","Peter G.

"We checked out Beacon Tavern this weekend during a ladies' weekend getaway, and are so glad we did!  The staff was so accommodating, as we arrived an hour and a half earlier than our reservation.  We all loved our entree choices, loved the beet salad small plate that began our meal. The curried pasta with lobster was delicious.  service was fantastic, Chef Bob and his kitchen staff were amazing.  Great find, we'll be back on our next trip to Chicago!","10/2/2016","5.0 star rating","TPGh2OEwVli9BJsWHi7O7g","Shelli B."

"I have recollections of bringing my kids to this space for Happy Meals.  The renovated space is lovely--industrial bistro chic.  The menu for lunch was great--I had soft shell crab slider and fruit bowl (heavenly concoction of yogurt, fresh fruit and grapefruit granita.  The staff keeps the place running and all seem to get along well.  I was nursing a cold that day, and when Jess noticed my cough, she brought hot water, honey and lemon to the table.  I recently heard that the one quality that cannot be taught, but makes a great server is empathy, which helps them know exactly what the client wants and when. Jess has this in spades.  Loved Beacon Tavern.","6/22/2016","5.0 star rating","l5XN99O-R0u4Mbq2mpXbug","Kathleen S."
