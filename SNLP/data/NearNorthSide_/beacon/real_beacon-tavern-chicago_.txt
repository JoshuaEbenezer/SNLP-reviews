We found this place through a reservation app, it was walking distance to the theater district, looked good, so we booked a reservation. The interior has a fun vibe and the outdoor seating looks like it would be a great place to have an after-work/happy hour cocktail. There was a decent crowd inside and out, not overly packed, and from what I could tell everyone was enjoying themselves.We started with a couple drinks - she had The Main Stem and I had Driftwood Bonfire. Both were great. I had another Driftwood Bonfire, my date asked for a similar drink to mine without the Mezcal, and they were happy to make it for her. That was delicious as well.For food, we started with the crab dip which was great. My date ordered the catch of the day (Halibut) and I ordered the bone-in ribeye. My steak was perfectly cooked, and the size of the cut was just about right. Ribeye is my fave but I sometimes avoid it at steakhouses because the portion is so huge! My date's poached fish itself was a little bland but it mixed well with the sides and other flavors, and it was a clean & nice sized portion. My steak came with the cauliflower gratin and we ordered the broccoli as well. Both sides paired well. Usually I like potatoes with a steak but with the cauliflower, I was fulfilled.Overall, I'm happy we found this place for a pre-show early dinner on a Sunday, and will definitely be back for happy hour drinks and dinner."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FjPaF4RidIgCTKRBnrn9Vw", "review_date": "4/16/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Brittany T.", "review": "Amazing place! It was a beautiful night to sit outside and enjoy the delicious food and wine. The waitress was fast, friendly, helpful, and informative.Our group of 4 decided to order wines from their 'sock drawer' list: 1 bottle for $49 and the second for $4.90. We asked the waitress for wine recommendations and both bottles were excellent. We ordered crab dip for the table and it was yummy and oddly came with Utz crab chips, but they were good together. My boyfriend and I split the pork belly, it was amazing!!! The belly skin was so crispy, the carrots were still crunchy (not the gross, over cooked, mushy kind) and the grits were creamy, smooth, cheesy, rich, and topped with red-eye gravy! Others in our party ordered the half dozen oysters, cauliflower gratin, and the fish n' chips (huge portion). All the food was impeccable. Too bad there was no room for dessert! I highly recommend this restaurant!

As other reviews have stated, the restaurant is hard to find and the map gets confused. But just look for the big Athletico Physical Therapy sign to point the way to this dimly lit and classic restaurant. Our table started with the shrimp toast which was absolutely delicious on crispy brioche and truffle butter. For those of you who are a bit more adventurous, the kitchen serves the shrimp heads on a plate and you can suck the juices out of them-- yum!As an entree, I got the Maine lobster bucatini, which is a hollow spaghetti noodle. It came with a light curry sauce (but wasn't spicy) that added a good flavor to the pasta without making you feel too guilty like some heavier cream sauces. However, it was a bit watery for my taste. The pasta had a healthy amount of basil on it, which isn't my favorite but some people like it. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother both got the burger, which was loaded high with onion rings and BBQ sauce. They both thought it was good but the onion rings had a bit too much batter and the height of the burger made it hard to eat. Overall, the restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the entrees were pretty good.

This place is awesome. I went here with a group of four for a business dinner. It's a really cute spot and one of the people I was with told me it actually used up be a McDonald's. No way!! lol this place was so cozy and cute.We actually didn't order any main entrees, but we did order cocktails, dessert, and EVERY and I mean EVERY side on the menu.I would recommend the \"Bonnie Situation\" cocktail. It's a seasonal cocktail with citrus infused vodka. Really light and refreshing. My favorite sides would have to be the cheddar bae biscuits (yummy!), the meat balls, and the brie (served in a very unique way).We got quite a few desserts and they were all good. We tried the mocha cake, the tarte tatin (apple), and the Chocolate Banoffie pie (which is definitely for sharing). I loved how we went about our dinner tapas style. We ordered just the right amount of food and we left full and happy.

It must have been kismet (or something) that made me find my way to Beacon Tavern after taking in the movie The Founder, a biopic about Ray Kroc, who built McDonald's into a global empire. I was eager to see how the Lawless restaurant group transformed the space from its former fast-food incarnation.I walked inside and immediately made my way to the bar area. It appears there is a dining room in the back that is quieter and more secluded. The decor is soothing, with its weathered woods, shabby-chic finishes, and blue-gray color palette. I expected a crush of people here around 1 pm and was pleasantly surprised that the place did not feel overcrowded. There were only two other people at the bar, which is why it was puzzling that it was hard to get my drink order, or even a glass of water, right away. I decided I wanted a Bloody Mary with Grey Goose vodka. The garnishes were sparing (lemon and a single blue-cheese stuffed olive). Although the first couple of sips had a nice, spicy kick, the drink seemed like it got watery pretty quickly. \u00a0I decided to stick with just one drink, although the cocktail menu and wine list looked tempting. It is worth noting that Beacon Tavern has happy hour during the week, from 3pm-6pm with specialty cocktails, wines, and draft beers.On to the food, I thought I had an idea of what to expect from looking at the menus posted online. Across the board the fare was on the heavier side, but I am hopeful that the arrival of spring will bring with it lighter menu selections. I had pretty much decided that I wanted the Reuben sandwich from the lunch menu only to be met with the explanation that only the brunch menu was available. I went with the breakfast version, the Reuben Benedict--essentially involving a poached egg. I felt the poached egg thing has been done to death. Not a knock on Beacon, but an observation of restaurant menus seemingly laden with poached eggs on salads, burgers, and even pizzas. Other than that, the corned beef was tender and the sauerkraut imparted a welcome tang. Next time I will probably ask more questions on the menu before ordering and might opt for a wine from the extensive wine menu versus a mixed drink."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6Zx7YiKFYXwqWXQBqSxoYg", "review_date": "2/12/2017", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "John G.", "review": "Four of us went for dinner and as we started to order some appetizers,we soon realized we wanted to try so many, that they would be our meal.

The tuna tartare was full of flavor and then the caviar oysters, which were perfectly shucked.The meatballs came with lots of sauce and melted cheese, which was messy but good!

I should probably start off by telling you they are very creamy and light so if you are a fan of lumpy mashed potatoes then this is not the place for you. We had the clams, crab dip, kale salad, and catch of the day. overall everything was delicious. I would suggest you ask them to substitute bread for the chips that come with the crab dip. The chips are seasoned so we found them to be a little too salty when combined with the dip, a nice pita bread would be a better pairing. The drinks and service were amazing and we really appreciate the attention to detail regarding the d\u00e9cor.

I think so. Beautiful food with a heavy seafood influence. I think it's best experienced as shared plates but there is a larger plate section for those who like the traditional route. The result is a perfect location for an intimate date, group of friends, dinner with the parents, or business dinner. Alone? Sit at the bar; there's a TV. Don't bring the kids. It's my date place and I need it to stay that way.It's located between the Wrigley building and Trump. You walk the pathway off Michigan Ave in between the Wrigley towers and it will be on your right. It's both intimate, classy, and trendy. Outdoor seating with large floor to ceiling windows that allow the high tops near the bar to feel like they're part of the outdoor space. There's also a dining room that's more formal.The service is phenomenal. Kevin always greets you at the door, stops by the table to check in, and most importantly, notices when your drink is running low and goes to the bar to get you another round.The drinks - the cocktail menu is extensive, a small novel really. I am obsessed with the water taxi. It's spicy and packs a little punch. I never get anything else. I would recommend telling the waiter what you like and letting them make recommendations. They really know the menu. The food - I've had a majority of the menu but who has time for everything? Let's focus on the highlights. The seafood is fresh, simple, but complex (how does that make sense in my head). Mostly its incredibly well done. I mean truly superb. I'm in love with all three crudo options so definitely don't skip this section. Maybe get more than one.Tuna Tartare - my personal favorite. It's so fresh and the cucumber provides a nice crunch. The sesame cracker is the perfect vehicle for this bliss.Hamachi - tear, let me set the scene: I went to two different Chicago hot spots and got hamachi crudo - fishy in that way that makes you wonder if you're getting food poisoning. I'd given up. I mean why do they charge so much to get your hopes up and leave you queasy? This hamachi - fresh, light, lovely. Thank you for restoring my love for hamachiSnapper - almost too pretty to eat - fresh (have I emphasized fresh enough) bites of fish with salty roe. Delish. Blue prawn - husband's favorite. It's pretty to look at but best eaten by mixing it up so you get a balance of tomato and horseradish. Baked Brie - in puff pastry - how can you go wrong? Enough saidPeekytoe Crab Dip - great starter for a small group. You dip chips into it which is slightly salty for me and I find you run out of chips before the dip is gone Shrimp toast - loved the toast but didn't notice that it also comes with a side of fried heads. Did not love that. All in all the shrimp toast was good but not better than the crudo or prawns so I'd only get it if you're ordering a lot of plates or you inexplicably want shrimp heads.Mediterranean mussels - with saffron and sourdough. You know what you're getting and it's goodMaine lobster - this is actually more of a pasta dish with a light sauce and some chunks of lobsterFish n' Chips, roasted chicken, filet, pork chop - pretty standard, good but not what I come here for. Be more exciting. You've done this before. Eating with your boring picky colleague? Recommend these while you have a real culinary experience.The burger - I rave about the seafood and you want a burger - no judgement here. It's delicious. It's about six inches tall but well worth the challenge. Scroll through the pictures and you'll see I'm not jokingDessertThe cheesecake - I thought the apricot would be off putting but it's balanced delicately with mint.

I had the fried chicken and Caesar salad while my fianc\u00e9 had the lobster pasta. The salad is huge and has a light lemony dressing. The croutons appear to be house-made and have an unusual crisp to them. The fried chicken entree is 6 pieces of lollipop style drumsticks. The breading is crisp and a little thicker than I like but the seasoning is on point throughout the entire bird. I'd order it again.I didn't get a chance to sample my date's meal.

The bright colors looked so appetizing. It was little too heavy on the sprinkle of salt but nothing too unbearable. It was still a really good salad. I ordered the peekytoe dip and it was rich. Perfect for happy hour and to share.My favorite was the broccoli although just a side, I thought the combinations of pine nuts and goat cheese was heaven.

The big windows, that they had open, allowed the cool lake breeze to keep the restaurant at an enjoyable temperature. The hostess was friendly and gave us a prime seat by one of the windows in the bar area. Our server, Selin, was very personable. She offered up helpful menu recommendations and seemed to be interested in the Pokemon Go game we were playing.

The highlight of our dining experience for sure! 5 stars*Fish & Chips was almost as good as the one I had in London. 4 stars*Uncle Eric's Roadhouse Burger is definitely a fork and knife burger. They are super generous with the cheese, the onion ring and tangy BBQ sauce put this burger over the top. 4.5 stars* Ice Cream of the Day was banana, chocolate chip, hazelnut, caramel swirl ice cream and it was delicious!!

I appreciated the fresh tarragon with the mussels but did not appreciate the lack of extra depth (could have used paprika or garlic), and the shrimp toast's buttery notes almost overpowered the other components of the dish. The shrimp heads were great and do speak to the quality of seafood they possess (as the simpler a dish, the more key the quality of the fare).May be the worth coming back to try their non-seafood fare...but based off my first impressions and for the price, I rather dine at the Tortoise Supper Club, where the servers are all charming, the food divine, and as a plus, live jazz music on certain nights!"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vUthM37V1IkWqy2laAzuhw", "review_date": "6/26/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Stacy P.", "review": "Been wanting to check this place out since hearing of its opening that was to be by the River. \u00a0From the group that brings Gage and Acanto, and I did a stage for them (for a pastry position), I was eager to try Kevin McCormicks desserts...

My friend was a little squeamish about the fried shrimp heads, but they were luscious and delicious. For dinner, there are not a lot of choices for entree', but I was debating between the catch of the day. \u00a0I had the lamb shank and it was rich and satisfying! There was a little too much lentils on the plate. The lamb shank was lying on a whole plate of lentils. That is a little too much for me, but the dish overall was amazing! My friend got the BBQ and it also looked really good as well. Service was amazing and everyone was very attentive. I also loved the open kitchen and was amazed how organized and quiet the kitchen was. We sat by the fireplace and it was warm and inviting.

In fact, the exterior of the building was not even finished! But certainy the staff training was.The remodeled space is beautiful, with a boisterous bar area near the entry, and a more sedate dining area on the other side of the wall.The short but very interesting menu focuses on small plates, mainly seafood, although heartier dishes such as fish and chips and even a burger are available.We began with two crudos, one hamachi, the other fluke. Both combined sauces and other ingredients with exemplary slices of raw fish, but the fluke was the better of the two, because of the trout roe accompaniment and surprising combination of fruity flavors. The crudos are not cheap, and the serving size lives up to its \"small plate\" billing.We also tried the king salmon entree, and while it was a delicious piece of salmon, the orange foam dotting the accompanying zucchini balls was the real standout, and would make a great vegetarian dish.Ironically, the largest serving we had was the clam dish listed under small plates. A generous helping of clams was topped with a fried egg and bits of what were, essentially, lardons, plus some thin slices of peppers. The combination of the ingredients was surprising and superb. It was the best thing we tried.The wine selections are limited, but there is an extensive list of interesting cocktails and spirits, tending towards bitter drinks like negronis and amaros, which suit my palate well, and go nicely with the various seafood offerings.Our server, Layla, was extremely knowledgeable and engaging, and made our meal a delight.

We had a party of four and were lucky and got seated within ten minutes. Our server was friendly and gave us our menus and took our drink orders. The water taxi cocktail and the mezcal/bourbon drink were really tasty. I ordered the grapefruit/rosemary drink and it was a bit bitter for my taste. For appetizers we shared the Hamachi crudo and half dozen oysters. The portion size of the hamchi was comically small, although the fish was well seasoned and fresh. I believe there were 3 tiny strips. The oysters were fine, but pricey at 18 dollars for half dozen.For my entr\u00e9e, I had the mussels with saffron. The portion size was good and the bread was nice and toasty. I wish there had been more bread to soak up the sauce with. My husband had the fried chicken which he sad was fine but not that crusty. The pieces were small as well. Our friend ordered the scallops and the portion size was once again, pretty comically small. We all gave her some of our food so she would have enough food. The 4th person in our party was smart and ordered the burger. The burger was gargantuan and came with fries and was \"pretty good\" according to the person eating it. Since the person who ordered the scallops was still rather hungry, we decided we should definitely get dessert. We chose the banoffee pie for the table. This was literally an entire pie. All be it a rather thin pie, but nonetheless a large portion and more than enough for 4 people to share for dessert. It was a nice combination of textures, although the bananas were a bit under ripe. I also feel that the ice cream could have been a bit more frozen since the thing started melting and became a mess within a few minutes. However, it was a mess that I was happy to eat :)Dinner turned out to be about 60 dollars a person, with each person having 1 cocktail. TLDR; So if you're hungry, order the burger and the banoffee pie.

I'd like to think that I'm usually a pretty observant diner. When I go out to eat, I'm looking for the entire experience. This place did an amazing job with their interior design and color theme. It's like a mix of classic, rustic, yet elegant. Kind of reminds me of Soho House, a little! I lovex3 the grey cabinetry and subway tiles on the wall but maybe I'm biased because that's the theme of my remodeled condo as well :) Side note: the manager told us that Billy Lawless and his wife had a big hand in designing the place. They also deliberately picked furnishings that would not typically be at a restaurant but instead exist at a home. First, there's attention to detail in the decor, and then the outstanding food and drinks. I didn't make it to try the $55 cabinet negroni (oof!) but maybe next time. My old fashioned was solid so a thumbs up. On to the food....Raw oysters and whiskey:I forget the name of it, but there's an option of getting a side of small carafe whiskey. You slurp up the oyster, pour some whiskey into the shell, and sip up the whiskey. Smart and decadent idea.Mangalitsa ham:Edible flowers on it? Yes.Snapper crudo:Oh my goodness. It's light and refreshing. Topped with trout roe.Mussels:The mussels were plumped, which are important! Fried chicken:It came in a brown paper bag which was really cute. And, there were two slices of Wonder bread on the the side.Fish and chips:Also outstanding.Banoffee pie:If you're in a group, get this.

While the address is Wabash, it's entrance is on the Rush side of the building. We arrived just in time for our reservations, so we didn't have a chance to check out the bar area. The place wasn't packed, but this is a classy interpretation of a tavern, with food to match. Not that different from The Gage, except the dining area is more segregated.We started out with cocktails, I had the Calavera, and shared the snapper crudo. My drink was ok, I was torn between it and the Autostrada, which was probably more to my liking. The crudo was beautifully plated and delicious. The snapper was delicate and the preparation was so flavorful; it was hard to exercise restraint and not keep it for myself.For our meals, we were both taken with the catch of the day, swordfish. Not wanting to order the same thing, he got the swordfish and I tried the salmon. I sampled the swordfish medallions, served over potatoes and spinach. I had intended to have more of it, but I was so into my own meal, I forgot. Salmon isn't a fish I order often. While I like it, most times I find the preparation on the dull side. The black truffle and orange gave it a rich, summery flavor; I had trouble putting my fork down. For dessert we (read: me) had the Beacon bar, their ice cream bar with banana ice cream, dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with sea salt. Just the like the rest of the food it was great and perfect for a hot day.Tables are close together; it's hard not to overheat your neighbors a little. We found the service friendly and on point, especially for a place so new. Billy Lawless and the manager dropped by to check on us and the neighboring table too. I was kind of floored when I overheard the ladies next to us grousing about our server and contemplating talking to a manager. I'm not sure how he offended them, we sat next to them for almost their entire meal; he seemed so attentive and jovial toward our table and theirs.Beacon Tavern is a great addition to the area and another solid Lawless venture."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=40jyU6WuoTpYPkg8tPClXg", "review_date": "7/29/2016", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Jen G.", "review": "Had a wonderful dinner here.

Clean dishes, beautiful setting- especially near the outdoor windows, incredibly sincere service, gorgeous slick and clean restaurant. Came here to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary- and my husband was brought me here as a surprise! He had called and mentioned our anniversary- and you should too if celebrating anything. Our reservation was for 8:00pm on a Saturday evening. 2 friendly hosts greeted us and we sat by the window as we requested. Our waiter really made our night. He was so approachable and seemed so happy to have us! He described every dish with excitement and detail, while giving his own thoughts as we debated between certain items on a dish. We appreciated how he talked about the Chef and he has prepares ingredients. Our favorite were the doughnuts. The perfect salty cod in between a hot and steamy ball of dough and cheese. It was a great start. The ricotta gnocchi was good- not the best I have ever had because I feel like the gnocchi was overcooked or overdone but it may have also been the ricotta. The lamb meatballs were light- perfectly minced meat. It accompanied peanuts, mandarins, \u00a0and olives. That citrusy touch made them clean eating delicious. For dessert- we asked about both the banana filled icecream lollipop and the chocolate tart. We settled in for the lollipop but our waiter surprised us with both desserts and sample tastings of prosecco to accompany it and he said he knew it was our anniversary. It was such a great surprise! The chocolate tart is amazing as you can see in the pictures. Worth it over the lollipop- but that was delicious too. As they have been open for two weeks, the waiter excalimed that most of the guests in their hidden treasure of the restaurants are tourists as the reastaurant is seen coming out of the Chicago Water Taxi. There will also be outdoor patio furniture coming to this restaurant too.

We were greeted with giant smiles and warm welcomes upon walking in the door. We had reservations, so we were seated near the bar area immediately. The decor was simple and contemporary. It became candle lit as soon as the sun started to go down. The owner, Billy and other friendly mgmt staff visited our table multiple times throughout the night and engaged in great conversations. Our waitress was on point and was well versed on everything on the menu including drinks. She checked on us often and ensured we weren't in need of anything at any time. The bus staff was quick to clean off the empty dishes and refill our drinks. The food was superb. The dishes are small and meant for sharing so our party of 11 ordered several dishes (some duplicates) and shared everything. Every dish was packed with succulent flavors and we kept wanting more. Here's a rundown:Baked Brie - soft and cheesy. Yum.Scallops - nicevcitrusy taste. Yum. Lamb meatballs - juicy with some greens. Yum. Ham - great combo with the blue cheese and sourdough. Yum. Crab - chilled leg, knuckle and claw you can dip in an incredible mustard mayo and chives or pickles. Yum. Fried chicken - tasty with the hot sauce. Yum.Mussels - swimming in tasty garlic aloli. Yum. Prime beef - juicy and tender dipped in beef au jus. Came with a scalloped potato. Lobster bucatini in curry- my favorite. Lumps of lobster and pasta noddles covered in light curry taste. Yum yum! Save room for dessert: Chocolate Banoffee Pie - creative and delicious concoction of banana, chocolate, caramel and almond on a pie crust. Beacon bar - lightly flavored banana ice cream covered in a hard chocolate shell on a stick. Not for sharing, but still yum. Only suggestion I'd have would be to have bigger plates the small saucers were definitely not enough room for the multiple dishes we Katy couldn't get enough of. It was an awesomely great dining experience. Hats off to Beacon Tavern. Highly recommend."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BlE7UfjQt41NgTfd_Rm3XQ", "review_date": "1/29/2017", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Laura H.", "review": "Impeccable service and delicious food!

Personally, I like menus like this because it narrows down the choices. We ordered oysters- a bit on the small side for it's price but fresh. We also had grilled salmon and lobster bucatini. The pasta tasted a little more on the curry side which we didn't expect but overall it was good. I'm not sure if we would order it again though. The grilled salmon tasted like a grilled salmon. Kind of on the dry side but the vegetables and potatoes on the side complimented well with the fish. We also had cheddar biscuits. It was so soft and cheddar-y.

How can that be? The food is very good, just as expected from Billy Lawless and his posse, but what I find unique in all this is that by being a former Mickey D it has a limited footprint.

We next shared the Caesar Salad. \u00a0Incredible! When I say it's the best Caesar Salad I've ever had, I am sincere. \u00a0The mayfair dressing is of course in-house, made with extra lemon yet it's not too tart or sour. \u00a0The anchovies balance the lemon beautifully, and you get a full, round flavor without that \"sharp\" or \"overly salty\" taste. \u00a0The croutons are nice and thick and soft enough that they crumble when cutting them with a fork. \u00a0At our server's recommendation, we shared the burger and fries, the scallops, and the lobster. \u00a0I didn't realize a burger could taste that good, I sincerely didn't! \u00a0It was juicy, made with quality beef and we had it cooked medium rare (to eat any type or cut of beef any other way is for uncultured troglodytes!). \u00a0It was dripping a marvelous juice from the burger that soaked the bottom of the bun, but wasn't fatty. The Taleggio cheese didn't overtake the beef, and the pickles were a remarkable and integral complement to an exceptional burger. \u00a0I'm sorry Rockit, your coveted spot as the best burger in Chicago has been supplanted (Kuma? Pah-lease! Don't be absurd!).The most incredible thing I've eaten in a very long time was their lobster with bucetini pasta served in a bowl. \u00a0There were huge chunks of absolutely delicious and incredible sweet lobster that will definitely fill you up. The choice of bucetini was integral to the dish because the sauce was apparently just a simple mix of lobster \"jus\" a hint of curry, and lime to bring out the flavor (don't embarrass yourself and ask for Parmesan, Italians won't put it on seafood for a reason, so neither should you!). \u00a0I was literally spooning the sauce in my mouth like soup when the last noodle was duly slurped. \u00a0Most sauces are over-salted to compensate for lack of taste, but not this! \u00a0It was perfectly seasoned and not at all salty. \u00a0But to my point, as you know, bucetini pasta is not solid, it's hallow inside, like a \"pasta straw.\" \u00a0This dish allowed the pasta to soak up twice as much of the sauce which made all the difference, an ingenious move for such a tasty and light sauce! \u00a0I must say that none of the dishes were salty. They really are masters of flavor.Finally, I cannot close this review without mentioning the \"Old Fashioned\" I had. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of old fashioneds. \u00a0Not sure why, just not. I'll drink them, but I'll rarely order them. \u00a0I was encouraged to order one as this is a house specialty. \u00a0Rarely does one describe a cocktail as \"delicious\" but that's what it was! \u00a0The Old Fashioned was absolutely delicious, incredibly smooth, not bitter, and clean. \u00a0I can only say the bitters must have made the difference here. \u00a0When I go back, I will definitely order at least two more.Do not walk, run to Billy Lawless' new restaurant! You won't be disappointed.

Unfortunately. The noodles are simply boiled and placed in the pasta. The lobster tasted fresh. The creme and basil was a nice touch, however, it lacked flavor. I would've liked to taste more robust garlic. The broth was basically Tomato soup or tomato bisuqe with some chives. It was alright, for $33, you're mostly like paying for the lobster, not everything else. I'm big on FLAVOR, if it's bland, it's bland. I don't care how fancy it sounds or what's included.I also tried the fries that people were talking about with the garlic aioli, the fries were just \"OK\", not sure what people were raving about. \u00a0The garlic aioli was just alright. The Hogsalt Restaurant Group does it much better at Au Cheval, Gilt Bar, Small Cheval, and 3 Arts Cafe (they use the same everywhere)... Far better fries. I may come and try this burger the following week to see how it is.I had a great server and he was very pleasant and attentive. The management greeted me farewell as I left and were kind. This place has the potential to be a crowd favorite, however, with seafood being the draw at this place, if the other menu items are just as bland in taste as the Lobster pasta, it'll just remain a tourist spot and not a sought after destination spot in my humble opinion. The decor in this place was VERY NICE! However, a foodie like myself could care less about it, I'm all about food quality and taste.

Service was impeccable, and now my server's name escapes me, but he was great. I started with the raw oysters, and since I couldn't decide which ones to have they gave me half east coast and half west coast. Who really knew that oysters really do taste different based on location? They were both delicious, so I really can't tell you which to choose, although I think I lean west coast with their buttery flavor. Next I had the catch of the day which was a Hawaiian snapper on a bed of spinach with fingerling potatoes. Melt in your mouth good, seriously it doesn't get much better.

Food and service were both pretty good. I got mussels which were extremely tender and large. I've had much better broths though, which was disappointing. The cauliflower au gratin was almost like a cauliflower Mac and cheese, but not as thick. Broccoli was crisp and yummy but I didn't love pairing it with goat cheese. Shrimp toast is a small portion resting in a butter sauce. Good but probably not worth the price. The fried shrimp heads were not well seasoned. The fried chicken is pretty unique. They apparently brine it for a day and then let it sit in duck fat. The result is a very tender chicken that is perfectly crispy on the outside. The serving size was large, but the hot sauce was basic. Lastly, the pistachio ice cream is probably one of the best I've had. Very strong nutty taste. Overall, not your typical spin on some typical items, good..sometimes great, but didn't amaze me."}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JRs8b7uVUcT438aofCtBjg", "review_date": "7/26/2016", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_name": "Adrian N.", "review": "Was impressed by the location and decor.

We ordered the cheddar biscuits and kale salad to share among the 3 of us. The biscuits were absolutely delicious and I was tempted to place an order to go to munch on all afternoon (glad I didn't because I'm still ready to explode from the rest of my meal). The kale salad was disappointing - while the pomegranate, blue cheese and nuts were a yummy combo, the dressing was horrendously vinegary and just made the dish quite unpleasant. The burger was the highlight of our meal. While some fun sandwiches look better than they taste, the Beacon Tavern burger was awesome from both an appearance and a taste perspective. My friend and I shared the burger and the fried chicken sandwich...we both loved the burger but thought the chicken sandwich paled in comparison (well cooked, don't get me wrong, but nothing special). My colleague got the redfish sandwich and enjoyed it, but I didn't try it so I can't speak to it. The see if was great, and we overall had a great meal. 5 stars for biscuits, burger, and service...but a few misses in our meal.

Drinks are delicious new try the Autostrada. Oyster's were fresh and spectacular - I had them for an appetizer and then more as my entree. Interior is lovely. The manager (I believe his name was Kevin) came over and said hello, told us about the new patio, which is a terrific place to eat and people watch. Service was great and we had a really good experience. 3.5 Star Visit. The second time I went to Beacon Tavern, drinks again were delicious, fresh, & well-made. I had mussels, my adult son had fish n chips, and my daughter had the fish of the day. I love mussels but found these to be over-cooked, creating an undesirable texture - I was not a fan and didn't eat them. The fish n chips had an over-whelming fish flavor and the dish was nothing to write home about - my son didn't eat his either. The waitress didn't seem to notice or care. Location is great after doing anything along Michigan Ave and the River (Architectural Boat Tour).At this point, I think I'd visit again for drinks and appetizers, but will probably move on to another venue for dinner .... unless, I want a burger, Beacon is supposedly well-known for their burgers.

We've been anticipating having another restaurant so close - my expectations were pretty high.I've lived in the building for a year but I do remember when the restaurant space was occupied by a fast food chain. I was incredibly impressed by how the restaurant space was revamped (both interior and exterior). I had made a reservation earlier in the week. My party was greeted by super friendly staff and seated right away. We were seated at a table next to the bar rather than in the dining area in the back - my only complaint was that the noise level is high if you're seated there for dinner and not drinks. We asked the staff if they had any space in the back; unfortunately, they didn't, but they did their best to compensate with drinks, which I really appreciated. The manager, Kevin, came and talked to us personally twice, once to apologize for the seating and again to check on us after we finished our meals. It is more than apparent that the staff cares about their customers having a great experience.We had the Catch of the Day (swordfish with potatoes), Fish n' Chips, Ricotta Gnocchi, and Lobster Bucatini. All of the food we ordered was at our table in less than 15 minutes and was undoubtedly made fresh. The dishes were well-prepared and flavorful, and we all enjoyed the food. The only reason I can't give the restaurant five stars is because the portion sizes were pretty small, especially for the prices. That aside, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Beacon Tavern, and I'm looking forward to visiting more often before moving!tl;dr - great ambience, friendly staff and hospitable manager, small portions but delectable food"}, {"user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nYqkmLDo4Pg837fXr3f3Cw", "review_date": "7/20/2016", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_name": "Tom M.", "review": "Really good and fresh food.
