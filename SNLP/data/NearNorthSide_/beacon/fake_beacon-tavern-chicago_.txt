We started out with the cheddar biscuits which were flaky and rich. We then all ordered entrees. I got the vegetable stew, which was so good! Someone in our group also got the fish and chips, which was good, but not quite as good as the fish and chips over in Europe. My father ordered the tuna tartare, which he said was good too. All the beer was on tap, but being underage I tried one of the soft cocktails (the orange blossom one i think) and was pleasantly surprised. It was a bit bitter but had a really good flavor. We looked at the dessert menu, but in the end decided to grab Molly's Cupcakes (another great Chicago restaurant). I'm sure the desserts were lovely though. It was a little pricey, but the ambiance was good and the service was ok. The service was great in the beginning, but towards the end we had some trouble finding our waiter.
