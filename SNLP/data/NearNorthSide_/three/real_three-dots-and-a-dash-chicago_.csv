"To preface, I have never written a review. It's not like I am that person who trolls services on the internet. However, this most recent time here really upset me - couldn't pay me to go back. Have been several times and never thought the service was great but I am the least picky person ever. The most recent time, they were horrible. We brought a group of 25 and they were flat out rude. Acted like they didn't want us there (no one in our group was drunk or acted immature so it wasn't us). Terrible service. Unique drinks but who cares at that point.","4/9/2017","1.0 star rating","00_DPbbQ_-AxaZnm_D3Yiw","Kory W."
"Me and some friends had a extremely unpleasant experience at this bar last night. We were with a large group, and when they gave us a table not everybody could fit in it. So some of us didn't seat, which is totally fine, and we spent the night standing, ordering drinks at the bar. Every once in a while a friend from the table would come and we would switch places so that everybody could rest a little bit. Until then, totally cool.Around 1 AM a few friends had already left the bar so we could fit everybody in the table. In the next hour, another part of the groups left and they paid the check, since they had a tab (some of us didn't, because we ordered our drinks at the bar). And AS SOON AS THE TAB WAS PAID the staff from the bar came, not only one person, but FIVE, KICKING US OUT OF THE BAR. Our group was in the table for the HOLE NIGHT, and they just kicked us out being complete assholes. I guess they assumed that we were a bunch of random people that just sat at the table AFTER the group left. They didn't even bothered to talk, just went there with 5 security people (as if we were a bunch of criminals), and kicked us out. An incredibly demonstration of lack of respect for customer. We were there the hole night, spend a bunch of money in that place, and just kicked us out of the bar as soon as the tab was paid.I guess they might think they are the last coca-cola in the desert, to show this lack of respect for customer. I can't believe I gave my money to this bar and I'm sure this will never happen again, since I won't be going there ever again.By the way, I've created this account just to be able to give this place one star, how shocked I was by the way we were treated.","10/2/2016","1.0 star rating","7w6po5bLVYSfM38GFeKiuQ","Marina C."
"Cheezy Tiki bar. Very bright lighting. Ridiculous tasting drinks. Enough said. Try it out yourself, & see what I mean. It's just not authentic & is a pretentious tiki bar environment, one that I've ever witnessed. I know, I know that's a rather superlative statement. It's not just about ABV content any more!

"Horrible bouncer.  My friend, Cher has ataxia, which at times causes her to have slurred speech.  This was going to be our first stop,  because of the Yelp comments.  The bouncer was this cocky, regurgitate of a person who disallowed her to enter stating that she has ""already had too much""!  When we tried to explain her condition, he kept repeating ""that's not how this works"".  He was so inflexible, and toxic, and he couldn't imagine he would be wrong.  We quickly left to The Aviary, which is the best in Chicago. I don't care how good you are with service or drink flavors; It is all about first impressions and 3 dots is Awful!  Fire your bouncers or give them training!","2/15/2016","1.0 star rating","QxBolfV5X8K6pCcJJO2x5w","Charles G."
"Me and my boyfriend had high expectations for Three Dots and a Dash after reading about it on many websites and magazines. We are both bartenders and love tiki style drinks, so this was a must for our visit to Chicago.On Saturday he had the Mai Thai and I had the Three Dots and a Dash. The drinks were just as good as expected, but the atmosphere and service were not at all!We were expecting more of a laid back vibe like other Tiki bars we have been to. Three Dots and a Dash was a very loud club like setting. We waited at the bar, both staring at the bartender for over 15 minutes while he ignored us and served whatever girls with the lowest necklines caught his attention first. He was totally unprofessional and very slow at making drinks. When you are bar-tending at a busy bar with customers patiently waiting, there are plenty of ways to be fair and friendly. I work at a very busy bar and never ignore customers. If I am slammed, I let people who are waiting know that I'll be right with them and at least smile or say Hello. Also, when my bar is slammed I work quickly and not at the slow pace like this guy did. I've been to bars all over the US and he ranks as one of the worst bartenders I've ever had, it was that bad. The drinks were good (still not worth it though), but his attitude and actions ruined any positive experience we had for the night. It was a total letdown especially after being so excited to try this place.","1/5/2016","1.0 star rating","wJxdoqtiJnd_WwLRcz4BEg","Jane R."

"The service was really disappointing from the hostess who seemed annoyed that we even walked in to the waitress who would go missing for a half hour and impatiently take out order which she got wrong and it took another 20 minutes to get our drink. We ended up being overcharged and when we politely pointed it out she mumbled ""it's possible"" dismissively and grabbed the check to rerun it. No apologies. The rude service was definitely a grey cloud over the whole experience. I've been to many tiki bars and this felt like a Disney version. Really exciting at first but then feels quickly kind of empty and void of quality and a good vibe. Drinks were strong and sugary but not that interesting. I wish I could give this place rave reviews but it fell flat.  :(","5/28/2015","1.0 star rating","-vJxTUvyn69yH-v4nKH8cA","Bethany R."

"I've tried twice, and still can't get inside Three Dots and a Dash. The first time, the line was simply too long and wasn't worth waiting in the cold. But the second time, my friend couldn't get past the bouncer. She is over 21, and had a legal (but out of state) ID. When we asked what the problem was, the bouncer rudely replied ""I don't have to explain myself or give a reason. I'm not accepting that ID.""Give me a freaking break. She uses that same driver's license to get through security at the airport. Apparently, what's good enough for TSA is not good enough for Lettuce Entertain You.

"Found 3Dots on Yelp...good reviews and the price is not too expensive. Everything was great except for the fact that when we got there punctually at our Monday 6:30 reservation, no one came by until I waved to a waitress walking by who had just taken an order from another table. That was at 7:10. Luckily for her, I wasn't that upset because the gals and I were too busy catching up for most of that time. I had the Painkiller drink and tuna & chips appetizer. Delicious. The chips were to salty for my liking but the tuna balanced it out. Oh and the hostess, a short gal, seemed to have no interest in being. She had an ""I hate my job"" attitude. I recommend this place for groups and for the drinks- it'll distract you from the mediocre service.","12/17/2014","3.0 star rating","K2dosxV-ofqWaQfHNZSUrA","Jasmine P."

"Came here a couple times now with some friends the first time on a Saturday night when they first opened and this past Friday night as well. I wasn't a huge fan the first time and this second trip pretty much confirmed it. It's located in the alley behind Paris Club and there are blue lights and door guys that alert you to its' presence. The ambiance was very tiki bar-esque with the decor making you feel like you're no longer in Chicago. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of those kinds of bars in general, especially when the clientelle are mostly River North types. You can't really have a pretenteous tiki bar, that's kind of an oxymoron. But the Paris guys did this one so whatever. The drink menu is physically large but only a medium sized list of options. They have interesting vessels with which they serve the drinks but what's inside the glass isn't very pleasing. I have tried about 5 of their drinks now and convinced they don't have a clue of how to make them taste good. Literally every drink I bought or tried tasted like pure alcohol with a touch of flavor. I'm usually not one to complain about strong drinks but those are usually for my AND drinks (beam and coke, rum and coke, vodka and soda, etc.) not for my specialty drinks. Not to mention there are a thousand ingredients in each drink which increases mixing time considerably so there is usually a packed bar. The dance floor is very small and the music changed drastically between the two nights I visited. First time was Matt Roan and he was great as usual but second time was some dude and he played an eclectic mix of genres that had me confused. Nobody danced. Staff seemed nice, no complaints there. Overall I'd say TDaaD was ok, something different in Chicago but not sure if something like this is going to last once the novelty wears off. Oh, and they are a carbon copy of a London tiki bar that's been selling treasure chests for years.","9/23/2013","3.0 star rating","Z-Bnkz4SujaUAkDL4r_-qg","Sumeet M."

"I have only been here for drinks. It is a fun, creative atmosphere. If you want speciality cocktails it's a place to go. It is usually very crowded however, hard to hear one another and has a long wait.","4/27/2017","4.0 star rating","IOdEvh1fxPXA7kSB3CHCFg","Shannon L."
"Pros: Tasty tiki drinks, enjoyable atmosphere. Cons: A little on the expensive side. Also, it's hard to get a table there without waiting in the lobby for an hour or so. An establishment shouldn't be criticized for being enormously popular, but it sucks to have to wait every time you go. Next time I'm just going to make a Mai Thai in my basement, dim the lights and listen to Les Baxter Exotica.

"As if this place needed another review!It's great for the experience - it's hard to find tiki bars in downtown Chicago but if you want to escape for a little bit, it's perfect. The drinks are about $13 and they're strong as hell. 2 will keep you buzzed for the night -- in the best way possible.My friends and I ordered so many but my favorites were the mai tai and the painkillers. You'll see skulls next to a few drinks on the menu. Be careful - they are STRONG.The ambiance is great and if you go on a weeknight, the lines aren't too bad and you'll get a table pretty easily! I would also recommend Lost Lake, since it was started by the same person! It's kind of like a scaled down version of Three Dots. So glad I went! Service was prompt and great too!","5/19/2016","4.0 star rating","AHG6w2TJ4GcXwvm5sYqwsQ","Barbara S."
"I was actually excited for this particular River North tiki couch as soon as I Had learned of it, and I wound up coming here three nights in a row (Thu-Sat). It definitely lives up to the hype! The demonstration of the beverages is just outstanding - garnishes change from banana dolphins (my favourite) to actual blossoms and fruit slices and nautically themed stirrers and tiki cups. The drinks themselves are also rather great, although occasionally it was difficult to identify the difference between a number of the beverages by flavor alone. My top pick for drinks would be the banana daiquiri as well as the solitary isle. Service at a table is top notch too!","4/25/2016","4.0 star rating","eZN5ot2Sn80rwlBIF1gnLA","Lottie Z."

"This is definitely a good place to hang-out to together with your friends or for a night out. Decent price. Decent place and Excellent Service. We had a great time together with my friends. Drinking fine wine while chit chatting. For a complement, we ordered some their special menus 5 spice ribs and flaming shrimp. The sauces and the garnishes that they put complement the flavorful taste. I enjoyed their different styles and quality of their food. It's so unique. Presentation was perfect. It looks so nice and creative. Dish tastes so delectable. We enjoyed everything on it. They have also selective of fine wines to choose from.Warning: This place is too crowded at night.  If you want to have a seat, you need to come early or better you made a reservation.Service is friendly. Staffs are helpful and attentive. Absolutely, I also love their modern and classy decor. It looks cool and nice. Ambiance is cool and perfect.

"Me and my boyfriend, having a great time staying here,because of nice ambiance of place. It looks like you are on the beach resto, seeing beautiful and cute decors.and a nice mugs and glasses,that it is fancy to look. They have a great food such as Thai Fried Chicken and Coconut Shrimp, and for a complement, we add cocktail ( PainKiller No.639) for refreshing.  A li'l bit problem, It takes too long to wait for an order to be served to you, so you need to have a strategy, not be bored while waiting for your order. But,It's worth the wait ,co'z they give the right order that is well prepared for you. And second, this place is too crowded, if you go late at night,so it's hard to find a nice spot to eat and drink. If you want to have nice spot, you need to take a reservation on it. or you come a little bit early,to find a nice spot.","3/10/2016","4.0 star rating","kgn23PCroBbmrpg52Wy-Xg","Kyle J."

"I went here on a Thursday night after 5. We found a spot at the bar right away. Drinks were good, my favorite being the 3 Dots and a Dash. My MaiTai was a bit bland as MaiTais go. Loved the atmosphere. The skulls rock. Prices were a bit high.  The food was good but the portions were a bit small for the price. I wanted a glass, but $20 is a bit steep especially when you just paid $13 for the drink (Trader Vicks used to give you the glass for free). The Bartender was excellent.

"Fantastic place. Wandered over here with my wife when we had some time to kill before a wedding for some drinks. Wound up getting the chips and guac, as well as a couple of mixed drinks, and I also tried an age rum. Fantastic rum selection, wonderful drinks, fun theme and all well-executed.","12/31/2014","4.0 star rating","IondZrakn8LHbTpAfrweFQ","John H."

"This place was good for it's setting, and the drinks were ok...but I probably wouldn't go back. Drinks were a bit expensive for what they were. A good place to check out for what it is, maybe the one time.","5/28/2014","4.0 star rating","Ecefqtbky29CqqElL1LHZw","Kavi P."
