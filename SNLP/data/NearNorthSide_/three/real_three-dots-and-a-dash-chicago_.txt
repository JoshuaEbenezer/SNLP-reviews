[{"review": "To preface, I have never written a review. It's not like I am that person who trolls services on the internet. However, this most recent time here really upset me - couldn't pay me to go back. Have been several times and never thought the service was great but I am the least picky person ever. The most recent time, they were horrible. We brought a group of 25 and they were flat out rude. Acted like they didn't want us there (no one in our group was drunk or acted immature so it wasn't us).

We were with a large group, and when they gave us a table not everybody could fit in it. So some of us didn't seat, which is totally fine, and we spent the night standing, ordering drinks at the bar. Every once in a while a friend from the table would come and we would switch places so that everybody could rest a little bit. Until then, totally cool.Around 1 AM a few friends had already left the bar so we could fit everybody in the table. In the next hour, another part of the groups left and they paid the check, since they had a tab (some of us didn't, because we ordered our drinks at the bar). And AS SOON AS THE TAB WAS PAID the staff from the bar came, not only one person, but FIVE, KICKING US OUT OF THE BAR. Our group was in the table for the HOLE NIGHT, and they just kicked us out being complete assholes. I guess they assumed that we were a bunch of random people that just sat at the table AFTER the group left. They didn't even bothered to talk, just went there with 5 security people (as if we were a bunch of criminals), and kicked us out. An incredibly demonstration of lack of respect for customer. We were there the hole night, spend a bunch of money in that place, and just kicked us out of the bar as soon as the tab was paid.I guess they might think they are the last coca-cola in the desert, to show this lack of respect for customer. I can't believe I gave my money to this bar and I'm sure this will never happen again, since I won't be going there ever again.By the way, I've created this account just to be able to give this place one star, how shocked I was by the way we were treated.", "user_id": "7w6po5bLVYSfM38GFeKiuQ", "review_date": "10/2/2016", "review_rating": "1.0 star rating", "user_name ": "Marina C."}, {"review": "Cheezy Tiki bar.

We are both bartenders and love tiki style drinks, so this was a must for our visit to Chicago.On Saturday he had the Mai Thai and I had the Three Dots and a Dash. The drinks were just as good as expected, but the atmosphere and service were not at all!We were expecting more of a laid back vibe like other Tiki bars we have been to. Three Dots and a Dash was a very loud club like setting. We waited at the bar, both staring at the bartender for over 15 minutes while he ignored us and served whatever girls with the lowest necklines caught his attention first. He was totally unprofessional and very slow at making drinks. When you are bar-tending at a busy bar with customers patiently waiting, there are plenty of ways to be fair and friendly. I work at a very busy bar and never ignore customers. If I am slammed, I let people who are waiting know that I'll be right with them and at least smile or say Hello. Also, when my bar is slammed I work quickly and not at the slow pace like this guy did. I've been to bars all over the US and he ranks as one of the worst bartenders I've ever had, it was that bad. The drinks were good (still not worth it though), but his attitude and actions ruined any positive experience we had for the night.

I wasn't a huge fan the first time and this second trip pretty much confirmed it. It's located in the alley behind Paris Club and there are blue lights and door guys that alert you to its' presence. The ambiance was very tiki bar-esque with the decor making you feel like you're no longer in Chicago. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of those kinds of bars in general, especially when the clientelle are mostly River North types. You can't really have a pretenteous tiki bar, that's kind of an oxymoron. But the Paris guys did this one so whatever. The drink menu is physically large but only a medium sized list of options. They have interesting vessels with which they serve the drinks but what's inside the glass isn't very pleasing. I have tried about 5 of their drinks now and convinced they don't have a clue of how to make them taste good. Literally every drink I bought or tried tasted like pure alcohol with a touch of flavor. I'm usually not one to complain about strong drinks but those are usually for my AND drinks (beam and coke, rum and coke, vodka and soda, etc.) not for my specialty drinks. Not to mention there are a thousand ingredients in each drink which increases mixing time considerably so there is usually a packed bar. The dance floor is very small and the music changed drastically between the two nights I visited. First time was Matt Roan and he was great as usual but second time was some dude and he played an eclectic mix of genres that had me confused. Nobody danced. Staff seemed nice, no complaints there. Overall I'd say TDaaD was ok, something different in Chicago but not sure if something like this is going to last once the novelty wears off.
