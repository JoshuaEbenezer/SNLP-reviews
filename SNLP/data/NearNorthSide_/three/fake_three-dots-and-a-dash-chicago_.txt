The place was super busy but if you got the attention of one the bartenders - you'd be serviced promptly... Another tip - go with a tall person!I got the Aloha Felicia - absolutely adored the pineapple skull mug. We later shared the Port Light (for 2). The fog and light were definitely cool to experience but at $40, likely will not be getting it again as the drink itself was nothing mind-blowing. Also note that you can request to purchase any of their awesome tiki mugs! It would have been nice if these areas were regularly tended to as there were already quite a few mugs left by previous customers at this ledge we occupied.Overall, this is definitely a fun place to go and especially to show visitors. Also, since this is a destination for many, it does create a fun diverse crowd. I even conversed with nearby out of towners (which is uncharacteristic of me), bonding over our awe of some other customer's drinks.

The line was long and it was December, but it took us less than 20 mins to get in. I got the banana daiquiri and it was super yummy! I've been here at least two more times. One of those times I got the mai tai. I usually don't order this drink but..loved it! Drinks are at least $12+ which is a bit of a splurge, but worth it!

Though their having a good time, they are serious about making each drink delicious and spend quite a bite of time preparing each concoction. Most of their signature drinks were about $14 and they have a drink to suit just about anyone's tastes. They also offer shareable drinks that served about 4 which looked really cool that ranged from about $60 to several hundred. My favorite drink was probably the Poblano Escobar which was a pretty fruit drink but had a little spicy kick. The Aloha Felicia was a refreshing fruity yet creamy drink with a combination of coconut milk and basil which I \u00a0also enjoyed. Missionary's downfall is also a good one to try if you like the combination of citrus and mint. Their namesake drink was very strong and very citrusy.

Like I said, though, both were awesome and it was hard to choose when every other drink looked just as sinfully good.I'm obsessed with the mugs/glasses the drinks came in, and had I been drunk enough I probably would have splurged and bought one. \u00a0Yes, you can buy the mugs that the drinks come in, but for about $30. \u00a0They're super awesome, though! \u00a0Speaking of awesome, can we just talk about the actual atmosphere itself? \u00a0The lighting is very dimmed which sets the mood for a relaxing get together with friends; there's a bunch of lounges amongst the regular tables and the tiki bar itself dazzles with brilliance as it displays all of it's rum. \u00a0It's fairly big inside, but from what I hear this doesn't suffice most of the time due to hw buy it gets. \u00a0When I went on a weeknight it wasn't overly crowded and we got a table right away. \u00a0Obviously, the weeknights allow for easier access than do the weekends, but isn't that the case anywhere? \u00a0Okay, so we have established that drinks are the bomb and the atmosphere is legit - well what about the food? \u00a0I didn't eat much, and there's really not much to choose from (because it's primarily a lounge, duhhh), but we got the Thai fried chicken. \u00a0This was spectacular and I would highly recommend that you get it if and when you make your way to Three Dot and a Dash. \u00a0P.s. to actually get into Three Dots and a Dash you have to find the alleyway. \u00a0Here are some clues for finding it: there's a blue light that illuminates the entry way, there's a big old bouncer standing outside and there are most likely people wandering around the same alleyway, aimlessly looking around. \u00a0You have to be 21 to get in, so if you're not then I guess you're S.O.L. \u00a0Once you're in, though, you are golden and you're about to get tipsy! \u00a0(\"Everybody in the club get tipsy!\")Although all the drinks have multiple components to them, the bartender(s) are efficient in making them, but the serving staff does a good job of making sure all the patrons are getting what they need and in a timely fashion. \u00a0Overall, this is a great establishment and I'm excited to come back for more drinks. \u00a0Aloha for now!", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5hbs6TwGyT2YQKeN3xef_A", "review_date": "6/19/2016"}, {"user_name": "Katie Z.", "review": "What a fun bar!!

We were celebrating a birthday ( had the birthday balloons at the table to prove it!) and the server just gave off the energy/vibes that she did not want to be there or tried to ensure we had a pleasant experience. At one point someone in my party sent back a drink because it wasn't what was expected and she paused and had an attitude about it, although she did give them a chance to order another one.I don't have a problem with paying a couple more dollars for a cocktail due to it's real estate but, I do have a problem when it isn't worth it!

I love the vintage Mid-Century feeling and pretending I'm on some island in the middle of nowhere without a care in the world. This bar provided that exact feeling. I didn't have a care in the world here. Everything was perfect. When we arrived it was PACKED. Can't blame them for being really good at what they do. We put our name in with the hostess and they told us they would text when they had a seat for us. I figured we would end up standing the whole night, but that was not the case. We stood by the bar and watched the bartender work his tropical tiki madness. Grabbed our drinks and *bling* text message. We could sit down. Perfect timing. The place was beautifully adorned in tiki lounge craze madness. Although, it wasn't stuffy and dusty. You were truly transported to another place and time. The servers were attentive and friendly. You were never waiting around to order another drink. SPEAKING of drinks. I've never seen a bartender so passionate and delicately build a drink the way this place does. From precisely measuring the ingredients to shaving fresh coconut and \u00a0adorning your cocktail with fruit and flowers, this place cared about every step of every cocktail they made.

When we were walking, we actually passed it without even noticing it. So just note that the entrance is actually in the alley. When you enter, there is a wall of skulls before heading downstairs and it was so beautiful. Even when we were downstairs, the decor was amazing. It definitely kept with the tiki theme and it was so cute. We grab three drinks to share amongst the two of us and seriously it all very strong.

Okay, so I wasn't particularly looking to experience that last part since it was my last night in the city and didn't exactly want to wake up at 1 p.m. with a huge hangover before my flight. Apparently, Three Dots and a Dash shares the same address with Bub City but Three Dots and a Dash's entrance is in the back alley between North Clark and North Dearborn...which is makes this place kind of hidden, but not quite so because almost everyone knows about it.I was not happy to see a line stretched down the alley/parking lot, especially in the cold but the 20-minute wait was not awful. I haven't been to enough bars in Chicago to know if bars usually get crowded to the point where you feel claustrophobic and have to squeeze in to order at the bar, but I can see why they like to keep a limited capacity. It was not overwhelming at the bar and it was pretty refreshing to not even have to try to flag down the bartender (who I think his name was Eddie) and have him come to you. I had the Bunny's Banana Daiquiri and I love that they used a real banana in the mix but oh man, this was too sweet for my liking; the best I can describe this is that it's like a spiked, watery smoothie. This was no light drink at all--the mix was heavy (not necessarily heavy on the alcohol) and will probably make you regret having dinner. My friend had the Dead Reckoning and it was a lot lighter. They seem to mainly use Jamaican Rum in their drinks, so a plus if that's your calling. 5 starts for presentation, too.This place was filled with a lot of nice people and because they limit a certain amount of people at a time, you will probably not have to push your way to get through and get elbowed.

All of you ARE right ... almost. Your reviews both hate filled and adoring are right to you. \"3 Dots and a Dash\" is like Mackinac Island fudge, \u00a0The Exorcist, The Rolling Sones, Trump, or heterosexual sex. You either like it or you don't. Can't make anyone like anything. But those that LOVE it - LOVE it! I won't say those of you that don't like \"3 Dots\" don't \"get\" it because I HATE when I hear that. (Mostly from my wifey poo.) For instance after lame romantic comedy she'll say to me \u00a0\"You just didn't get it\". And I'll reply back \"Nope just didn't like it.\" For instance I enjoy ALIENS 4, Akira, Spirited Away, Japan over France for vacation, and truly believe The Moody Blues \"A Question of Balance\" is the greatest single recording from in history . Good luck convincing anybody else. I've tried and failed . We humans like what we like. I'm freakie for tiki. You just don't like it. That's it! But I believe many of you may grow to dig \"3 Dots and a Dash.\" Someday. One day you may (sorry) \"get\" it. I used to be teased about \u00a0my love of the musical Hamilton, Shatner, West World, The Prisoner (TV show), Iron Man, Biale Black Chicken wine,and Star Trek. Now they are all retro hip and cool. I was ahead of the curve. However, sometimes I'm not ahead of the curve. Lost in Space (1965),Johnny Quest, Land of the Lost, Thundaar, Voltron, The Kinks (Arista years), Ultraman , Riverview Amusement Park collectibles, Johnny Socko, & Wizzo the Magician, I'm still almost alone on in my appreciation of.\"3 Dots & a Das\" could turn out to be either for you . Epic or just Blah. Both crowds correct.To me? EPIC! Big time!I'm fascinated by tiki culture. It's my private obsession. I've always DREAMED of being in a Tiki Bar when it was happening, hip, and THE place to be. Don the Beachcomber, The Luau, Trader Vic's, Kahiki, or Kona Kai, in their heyday in the 1960's. Wow, to have been there once upon a puff when Tiki was THE scene. To me it'd be like being at the original Playboy Club in Chicago, The Pump Room w/ Irv Kupcinet and Sinatra drinking 2 fingers of Jack, or seeing The Doors on stage at The Whiskey a Go Go, back in the day. My experiences of seeking tiki in every city during a lifetime have always lead me to the old, the faded, and the dingy. Their heyday but a mustard burp lost to the vapor. Their glory years in the rearview mirror.So my visit to \"3 Dots and a Dash\" made me burst w/ joy and almost cry. Sincerely.It's but a dream. An oasis in a basement. Beautiful women in Polynesian attire bring bizarre expertly crafted concoctions loaded w/ the freshest fruit and ingredients YOU CAN TASTE. (Their intricate drinks aren't from some stale powered mix or a can.) Exotica fills you from first sip.Notice the thought that went into the menu . Kitsch overload! Just holding that menu was worth the visit. Did I just time travel? Nobody does menus like this anymore. Slapdash and rehash is the norm now. Not here. Delight is in the details. Notice the different sculpted glasses for every drink!!! Each individual \u00a0one a work of art.It has an almost \"secret\" speakeasy entrance The Batman would tip his cowl to.The swizzle sticks are mermaids.Is that a full cinnamon stick and large chunk of coconut in this icy ceramic totem? Now my treasure is others trash. I get that! You may HATE this place. Some evidently do. I read your reviews. But I think they are \u00a0the born in Chicago types that sit at Blackhawks games and cheer on The Redwings. Jag offs. Some will see silly glasses, tacky menus, dank basement, and sexism on display in some of the art and required staff garb. Ugh. I feel sorry for those that recoil in falsehood. Oh , the deluded brainwashed masses.The offended by everything crowd. A cancer to our society really. \u00a0Sorry, I keep getting off topic because I'm still buzzed out of my zombied skull right now.If I wanted to be like hipsters that breathe out loafs of loathing at all they survey I would complain that the music they play wasn't even a bit tiki. The music could be much better. They could throw a bit of exotica or space age bachelor pad music \u00a0in. Heck, even a minute of Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Bird music might be nice. Xylophone anyone?The food I tried was great but the drinks are the real stars. Drinks that could fuel a stealth bomber.BEWARE LADIES you might wake-up w/ someone that looks like me next to you if you aren't careful. Deceivingly POWERFUL in their almost unseen ability to sneak up on you their drinks are like an invisible maniac in his invisible Cadillac that run you over. Tiki drinks will get you gurglerbslobbered. (That's a just now made-up word that sounds like what I feel like right now.)

However tables are usually full so if you want to lay back and relax at a cool looking table make a reservation because it will be about an hour and a half to get the next free table!The drink I had was the Seasonable Doubt with gin, it was good for the price but I am definitely excited to go back and try their other drinks", "review_rating": "4.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bW9EyOtr3VrpotCW32zz8Q", "review_date": "12/27/2016"}, {"user_name": "Gary B.", "review": "This place is very interesting and very popular. Depending on your arrival time you may be on a wait. \u00a0This is a tiki place and the drinks are themed accordingly. \u00a0The drinks are strong so you may want to watch the intake...or not depending on your intentions.I had the banana daiquiri which comes with a dolphin head made out of a banana. \u00a0The attention to every detail can be seen from the menu to the execution of making the drinks.If you are looking for a shot and beer type place I don't believe that you will enjoy yourself. \u00a0If you are looking for something different, you will enjoy yourself.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VxiXcXUH8JWee5W7_6Uu-g", "review_date": "9/13/2016"}, {"user_name": "Sara G.", "review": "My only complaint would be the line to get in and how long it took, but it was January when I went and I am a Floridian. Freezing ballsack cold, which I'm not used to. Once we finally got in though, I completely understood why there was a line. This place was awesome.I went with my boyfriend and two friends who had been there one other time. I don't remember exactly what drinks we got, but I remember asking for a whiskey sour (I was newly 21) and the waitress immediately said \"we don't have any egg to make a legit one.\" We were all slightly confused and looked it up. Who knew. lol. Atleast we know their staff really knows their drinks. We ordered another round of drinks and a few appetizers and hung out for a while. The price was pretty steep, but I believe well deserved. If I'm every back in Chicago, I'll most likely go again.

Establishments in the US that do tiki cocktails right are few and far between. Outside of Three dots there is it's sister Lost Lake, Smugglers Cove in SF, Latitude 29 in NO and the long shuttered but legendary Painkiller in NY to name a few. The reason I suspect outside of financial ones is that it is hard. I mean most cocktail bars are preparing 2 and 3 ingredient cocktails as their mainstay and then there are some tiki drinks that require 12 to 15 ingredients all in precise amounts and then there are the garnishes. \u00a0The location too is perfect and the ambiance has an appropriate amount of Tiki, without all the kitsch.", "review_rating": "5.0 star rating", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y5_I2mYAhAzhkhy4N-8zHQ", "review_date": "10/31/2016"}, {"user_name": "Oscar R.", "review": "Great place with a good atmosphere.
