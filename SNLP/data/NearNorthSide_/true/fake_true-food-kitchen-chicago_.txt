[{"user_id": "vLuVybrKq-GL86i-y5LdKA", "review_date": "12/27/2016", "review": "Eek, no. I work too hard for my money and I'm smart enough to use Zagat for premier local establishments. Here's why you should, too. I've never written a review like this, but I'm tired of corporate shams and I think most consumers are, too. Since most of the public reviews for this place seem to be paid for by their private equity firm (the manager told me it's owned by one), I'm going to review them here. I'm also a nutritionist with an MBA, so naturally, I had to try this place when I saw it. The space, with the wood accents and smart design, beckoned me to try it, too. Make no mistake: this is a mass consumer chain that imitates and insults real cooking and dining, and here's why:The variety should alarm you. The menu is a messy \"jack of all trades,\" which should arouse suspicion. Chicken, fish, streak, burgers, pizza, pasta, Japanese (Teriyaki), Mediterranean (Hummus), Chinese (Dumplings), Thai (Curry), to name a few of their regional dishes, and none are unique or noteworthy, though their ingredients are okay--I was told it's roughly 40% organic by the staff. For me, in the end, the experience made me feel as though I would've been better suited at a restaurant with a more definitive focus, like a Thai restaurant if I wanted curry; a Japanese restaurant if I wanted teriyaki; or a real pizza place if I wanted pizza--did I mention that their lifeless pizza sucks? Where's the flavor? As for the experience, we sat at the bar. I noticed that the pom chia limeade is made from concentrate. I saw the commercial jug they had bought from a purveyor in the fridge, and I watched the bartender mix a large batch with water. I assume the lemonade is the same. The lemons and limes in the fruit display are only for show. Some of the other fruits might be, too. Bartender splashed less than .5 oz of pomegranate juice in the limeade for color. The juice was regular Pom from the store. In fact, I never saw a pomegranate anywhere. The pom seeds in the medicine man came out of a pre-peeled, pomegranate seed package, which was also pulled from the fridge. Was surprised. Wife tried the Kale aid, which was okay but celery heavy. Also wasn't made to order. Bartender poured it from a jug, which was disconcerting because vitamins in fresh squeezed juice dissipate when they're not in a vacuum. Less than 15 minutes is the typical threshold. Bartender seemed confused when I told her, smiled, and went about her business. Also noticed that the apple soda and carrot tonic use less than 1 oz of juice apiece. It's mostly soda water and an intelligent layering of splashes. Smart bankers. The menu description makes them sound so delicious, but I wish you could see how they're made. After we ordered, the appetizers arrived in less than 5 minutes, which would normally make me ecstatic, but I wondered if any cooking had been done so I ventured toward their open kitchen. I saw par-cooked chicken sitting on cold sheet trays, and I saw piles of pre-cooked vegetables waiting to be reheated on sheet trays, too. The chicken on the chicken salad comes from a portioning bag that's pulled from a fridge. The Albacore Tuna was the same way. I saw \"chefs\" pull pre-seared, pre-cooked tuna from portioning bags, from the fridge, before they layered garnishes over the segments. They were presliced, too, in the interest of time. The quinoa burger patties were pre-cooked, too. They were sitting, cold, on sheet trays waiting to be reheated. Tofu was pre-cooked too, sitting in a pan in the salamander, waiting hot, til' someone ordered a piece. With all of this being said, it's probably safe to assume that the daily market soup is anything but daily, too.Conclusion? The plates look far more attractive in writing than in person. Miso glazed sweet potato sounds exciting, but the execution is anything but that. You must remember, the people doing the cooking here are working near minimum wage--these are mostly new industry workers seeking steady pay and kitchen experience that reputable establishments would never offer. It's a clever gimmick indeed, but I'm sad to say that this gimmick is better suited for consumers that are expanding their tastes from the likes of taco bell and dominos--this class will be most compelled by the experience. As for the rest, if you've ever seen the inside of Whole Foods, or any of the products they commonly sell, you'd know that this is too sophomoric for you.I should also note that I was harassed by the business owner and managers for posting this review.

Very considerate employees and visually appealing if you are like me and pay attention to floor design. I've been practicing Veganism for 3 years and I normally cook my own meals because most places I've been don't cater to people who choose not to consume dairy or meat. My girlfriend is vegetarian transitioning to veganism. This place was a great date night environment for the both of us. We were quickly sat. Unfortunately a pillar near the restrooms were blocking our view of everything. So our server kindly sat us in front view of the kitchen. I've worked as a kitchen manager and server for 4 years before going into the medical field. We loved seeing how hard everyone worked to make our food and how knowledgeable they were when I asked questions about certain items on the menu. \u00a0We shared Pomegranate Chi Lemonade (2), Merlot, Revolution \"Anti-Hero IPA\" , the Ancient Grains+Tofu, Spicy Panang Curry+Tofu and finished desert with the Apple Goji Crisp. Our pallets were more than satisfied. It was a little busy but it didn't seem like anything the cooks couldn't handle. They seemed happy and were rocking out dishes and prep which seemed surreal given I understand the sense of urgency everyone has to go through. I felt like I could jump BOH myself (haha). We absolutely loved the moss on the wall!!! The water pitchers seemed kind of small (more like a vase).
