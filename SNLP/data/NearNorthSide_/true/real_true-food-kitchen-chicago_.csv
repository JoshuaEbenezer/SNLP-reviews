"Overall: For a healthy and hearty meal it doesn't get much better than this!The good:""Earthy"",""organic"",""natural""...whatever words you want to use. You know what you're getting into here. And, it's all delicious. The menu covers plenty of options (all sounded amazing) from salads, bowls, sandwiches, entrees, apps, custom drinks. My entire table all got different items and we all loved it. The ancient grains bowl that I had was top notch; the glaze, sauces, and ingredients were great. Portions are ""healthy"" and I left full and happy. Service was friendly and the atmosphere is clean and ""trendy"".The not-so-good: A little pricey. The entire restaurant was a little loud which may off put some people.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 9.5/10","4/19/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O54qpaPFcfpR9rf7f6Ltag","Kyle D."
"I really like the concept here - healthy meals that don't make you feel guilty after eating them. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl. It was tasty, no complaints. We also shared the edamame dumplings, which were also good. On the inside, the place is gorgeous. High ceilings and lots of natural light; aesthetically, the place is stunning. It's a great ambiance for a date night or a group dinner. Be warned, it's noisy in here so if you go in a group, you'll likely be chatting with only the people immediately next to you. Oh, and it gets very busy despite the fact that it's a large place, so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. Otherwise, you'll be sitting in the bar area. My only complaint is that the food is pricey and the portions aren't exactly big for what you're paying. I guess portion control is a good thing?","4/30/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iCQysHJjDekomKQirkF43w","Jenn H."
"Had lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. It was VERY busy so I'd say book a table in advance. Service was excellent, very friendly waiter who made menu recommendations and was playful to our little toddler. They didn't have enough highchairs which wasn't ideal but we managed. Food was delicious. We had the beef tacos, mushroom pizza and the margherita pizza from the kids menu and two skinny margarita cocktails which were yummy. Price is on the high side however. Definitely a great place for vegetarians and vegans. Good clean food with good healthy options. I'd go back. And I'd recommend.","4/28/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=59eh1yiSQA6EWVj-3f7Smw","Marie M."

Kale Aid juice: 3.5Kombucha: 3.5Grass-fed Beef burger: 3Good meat and seasoning, but the bun was soft and wet. Not close to being the best burger, but good and satisfying.

"Come on in, eat your veggies and feel good about how well you adult! Am I the only one that feels proud when making responsible, healthy meal decisions in a city filled with indulgent comfort food? I know I'm not. The good news is, at True Food Kitchen, you can feel good about what you eat, without suffering through a flavorless meal that reminds you through every bite that adulting is hard. And if you happen to be having a day where you feel like adulting is extra hard, feel good knowing that True Food also offers a fresh and fruity cocktail menu as well.When we dropped by for lunch on a weekday, the place was packed, so make sure to make reservations. Once seated, we were able to order quickly, with the food coming out even more quickly. I ordered the Butternut Squash Pizza with smoked onion, organic kale, vegan almond ricotta, dried cranberry. The pizza was outstanding, and easy to share with a group. If you're ordering only for yourself, it will be more than enough and you'll probably need to take some home, so sharing is a great option. I also ordered the Seared Albacore Tuna salad, with  avocado, grapefruit, cabbage, cashew, watermelon radish, thai basil, sesame, chili garlic dressing. It was one of the beautiful and one of the best salads I've had in awhile. In fact, although full there was no way I was leaving my leftovers behind. Overall, loved the natural light and simplistic aesthetic of the restaurant and everything that our entire group ordered seemed to have been enjoyed. Now that I've discovered True Food, I look  forward to stopping by the location in the DC area in the near future.","3/31/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qI3uzegMdq3q3WxAajECGw","Tara L."
"Delicious food that was healthy and fresh. There were so many great options on the menu it was hard to decide what to get. I guess they get very busy because the hostess said there was a 30 minute wait without reservations or we could seat ourselves at the high top table. There were many open tables but they must have been for reservations. I got the spaghetti squash casserole and my friend got the inside out quinoa burger that came with a choice of kale salad or squash. We both loved our meals and the waiter was awesome. I would definitely go there again.","4/21/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uZzLrBQDj29O28Jj3WDfOA","Billy L."
"I'll just put this out there: I'm a horrible eater. I always crave fatty and ultra heavy foods. With that said, I was particularly surprised at how much I enjoyed this place. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and it was perfection. I could eat bowls and bowls of that stuff. The best part about it was that I was just the right amount of full and (for once) felt proud for putting something nutritious in my body!","4/12/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B0HexfN1tarLKbIcxvh4dA","Charisse B."
"Awesome food! Went here with a group and tried lots of dishes. We started with kale guac, which I'd say was good but fairly standard. We also tried the cauliflower (delicious!!) and edamame dumplings (amazing - so soft). Then we got the squash pizza, which was probably my favorite - baked to perfection and topped with the perfect cheese (if I remember correctly I think it was ricotta). We decided to add another dish - some sort of bowl plus steak (it had quinoa) - after feeling like we could eat a bit more, and that one became my new favorite LOL.Ended with two desserts - chia seed pudding and apple crisp. Both good but not must-haves, in my opinion. Good food, slightly $$ but awesome space and ambiance!","3/15/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z6UZvxZDgDsFn-f54QDzpQ","Susan L."
"I absolutely LOVED my two visits to True Food Kitchen. I agree with the reviews that state that you can leave here and NOT feel crappy from what you ate. I didn't realize this was a chain and haven't been to any of the other locations. The space is mostly bright, spacious, and so open! Initially, I thought the front room was the entire restaurant, but there's a whole other section in the back right next to the open kitchen!  The first time I went, we had reservations and were seated within 10 minutes. The second time I went, we walked in and were quoted 25-30 minutes and they texted as soon as the table was available. That second time I went, I was following the whole 30 eating plan and was able to make my food whole 30 compliant, which was AWESOME (and hard to accomplish at many restaurants). That time around, I had one of the salads and asked to modify it a bit. The waiter was extremely accommodating!Other items we have ordered include:+ Kale guacamole - delicious! I asked for veggies to dip into the guac and they brought a dish of crudite out.+ Edamame dumplings - REALLY good - the white truffle oil is a nice touch and the small amount of broth they come in is delicious. + Charred Cauliflower - the contrast of the harissa and the dates really worked for this app! so good!+ Butternut squash pizza - basically got this because we wanted to try the vegan almond ricotta, but REALLY enjoyed the entire pizza! Kind of oily at the bottom, but overall SO good (do you see a trend??) + Inside Out Quinoa burger - ordered this as my entree and loved it AND the hash that came with it! The quinoa patties were actually a bit dry, but otherwise the dish was fine.+ Spaghetti Squash Casserole - my friend ordered this and I had a bite. The sauce was pretty tasty, but it was insanely cheesy (which I usually wouldn't complain about, but if you're trying to make the dish healthier with spaghetti squash, the cheese is counteracting that effort)+ Spicy Panang Curry - another friend ordered this - I didn't try it. She said it was VERY good, just VERY spicy for her. She ended up asking for extra rice since she went through her portion quickly while trying to bring the spice level down a bit.For drinks, I tried the War of the Roses cocktail (special Valentines week menu) and the Farmer's Market Sangria- both were great.Overall, I loved this place. I cannot wait to try their brunch and go back to try more items on the menu!","4/6/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cp-rWPVqlGyuroPKoBefYQ","Ritu D."
"I ordered a kale salad with chicken! One of the bast salad that I have ever tried! But I just would like to point out that it will let you with bad breath hahahahahah seriously! It is so delicious but after eat it, just make sure that you have a trident in your bag hahahahahahaha it never happens to me! But it was immediately after I eat the salad! In general, the concept that the restaurant offer is amazing! Everything in the restaurant is seasonal, fresh, and so delicious! Excepted a drink that I order which was a grapefruit soda, it was horrible! I would like to come back and order different things on the menu!!! They offers not only salad, but also pizza, soup, burgers, wraps, bowls! The service was really good!The price: I order a salad, and a grapefruit soda and a plate with 2 tacos!

"This is a pretty cool restaurant to have in the River North area that serves healthier options.  The menu options at True Food Kitchen are flavorful and balanced.  To drink, I had the pomegranate Kombucha drink.  They use a light pomegranate syrup and mix it with the plain kombucha from the bottle.  They pour some of the bottle in a cup with the syrup, and give you the bottle on the side.  The bottle of the Health Aide Kombucha is huge, and could easily be shared with one other person.  I had never had Kombucha before my visit here and I had a good first experience with this ""trendy"" beverage.  I've been trying to track down other places in Chicago that sell this brand of Kombucha so I can drink it at home, but I haven't had luck yet.  I may consider buying it from True Food Kitchen on occasion if they let me ; )For an appetizer we had the edamame dumplings, which were light and tasty. With all of the dinner menu options that sounded delicious, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted.  I decided to go with the spaghetti squash casserole, and I was happy with this dish.  Even though I was pretty full by the end of the meal, I did have a scoop of their ice cream (waiter said this was made with almond milk), and it was a great way to finish the meal.  Our waiter did a good job and providing quality service and explaining menu items to my group of friends.  This place is worth checking out if you are in the River North area.","1/25/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=vsRPm_-WdtcY0CWZNz2u1g","Yvonne I."
"I haven't eaten processed foods in over 4 years, so it's really challenging to dine out.  So when I found out about True Food Kitchen I was super excited.  There are not enough places that focus on real ingredients that highlight the taste of the actual food without drowning in sauce, salt, and oil.  So far I've only eaten here once but that is enough for me to be hooked.  I can't wait to explore more of the menu items and the juices!  Thank you True Food Kitchen for making it easy to dine out without having to worry about what is in the food!","4/16/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8JvUGKKcTfAmkTBOmUIMzA","Casey F."

"Usually if I hear vegetarian or vegan I run the other way. Not that I don't enjoy a good vegan dish but many of these places are just waaaay too bland for me. This was a surprising experience-great flavor and filling. Absolutely loved the cauliflower and the guacamole. Yumm I could probably just eat those as my meal. The spicy Panang was actually very spicy which was great. I actually ended up dipping my mushroom pizza in the sauce it was so good. Drinks were only ok. Probably would order wine next time-I really want to try the horchata next time was well.

"I love the concept and open decor of this restaurant. The hostess and wait staff were very friendly. The edamame dumplings are amazing! I'll definitely get them again. They taste almost cheesy. I saw them hand make the dumplings as we ate which was cool and shows how fresh they are. I had the turkey wrap for my meal. The portion was huge! They let you choose between kale salad or sweet potato hash or half of each! I got half of each and loved the sweet potato hash. The dressing on the kale salad was way too bitter for me. I had a scoop of the gluten free vanilla ice-cream. It was delicious! To drink, I had the honey lemonade. It was OK but not my sort of thing. Overall, great experience!

"I really like the interior decoration at True Food as well as its well-lit space. The food, however, was quite a letdown. The matcha horchata was very mediocre--I like my matcha to pack a slightly bitter punch, and this was just a milky and lackluster version of it. We also got the charred cauliflower and pan roasted chicken, both of which were just ""meh"". Would return just to sit down with a friend in a beautiful space over a smoothie, but wouldn't get anything else.","4/20/2017","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fj5bAcfeggkXUfwCMewI9Q","Astrid G."

"Despite being a chain, True Food is such a great edition to the Chicago food scene. It is a much better dining out option filled with food groups and combinations that are good for your body. Having dined at locations in Arizona and California, I have been counting down for its November opening. True to form, the meal did not disappoint. The Fall menu is filled with good eats for every palate. Hummus - 4/5; great toppers and available with gluten free pita upon request. We also ordered a side of vegetable crudites. Medicine Man - 4/5; a tasty combination of antioxidants. Think berry flavored. Honey Lemonade - 3/5; refreshing but not a favorite. Would likely try something different the next time around. Scottish Steelhead ""Salmon"" - 4/5; it is trout that looks and taste like salmon. The smoked quinoa was the star on the plate. Ah-mazing. Highly recommend it. ($24) Spaghetti Squash Casserole - 5/5; of course I added a protein, namely chicken sausage to this delectable dish. It is my go to every visit because it is healthier, hearty option packed with flavor.  Squash pie with GF graham cracker crust- (vegan free too) 5/5; the reason I visited in Fall on a 24 degree weather day.Our total (appetizer, two entrees, two nine ounce glasses of wine - Pinot Noir & Rhone blend, two desserts and two refreshing non alcoholic drinks) was $131 before gratuity. ... ***********Also most appreciative of our server Gina for asking a manager for new seating when we asked for a place  away from the entrance. After being told nothing else was available by the hostess, she knew differently and saved the day.","12/10/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WJR8f_QNG1kuPq5V6RxeFA","Trina K."
"A friend turned me on to this new restaurant and I'm glad they did. I hv been here twice. It is an oasis in the downtown area. It is a place where sane, healthy eating takes place. First, the atmosphere. Clean and green; Open and welcoming with lots of light, windows and atmosphere. Everything is in the open. People cutting, chopping, slicing healthy vegetables and ingredients. The menu is full of savory concoctions with health in mind. Healthy ingredients spelled out. I hv had the Spaghetti squash each time and it's delicious. My friends hv  had Ancient Grains and salads.

"Even though I found out this place is a chain I absolutely love it!!!! I still can't believe how healthy it is because it taste so good. The food here is so fresh that they don't even have a freezer. I have had many of the menu items now, but my favorite is still the Brussels sprout wild mushroom Pizza. The saltiness and the the flavors together are a winning combination. On my last visit I went with a few friends and they got the teriyaki bowl. It was good, but something was a little off from the last time I visited. We also decided to share the Apple crisp for dessert. It was just okay. My favorite dessert would have to be the squash pie. It may look boring, but the texture is creamy and it tastes like a pumpkin/sweet potato pie mixture. I also must say you won't be disappointed with the fish tacos.

"My husband and I went to True Food Kitchen for a healthy lunch, and I was excited to try the edamame dumplings with truffle because I have the irrational truffle bug.  Everytime I see a unique combination with truffle I am very intrigued.The food we tried:- Edamame dumplings - I would give them 1 4.5/5.. the flavor was good but the truffle was a little too subtle for me- Ingredient (season ingredient dish) - 5/5 - I loved how each vegetable was cooked in this, and the horseradish sauce brought excellent creativity that succeeded.  If you are not a big horseradish fan that is fine because it is a subtle flavor that is not overpowering - just the right amount.  I wish I knew the secret to this.- Ancient grain - 4.5/5 - This was great, but I have seen dishes like this before so nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion.  Still a solid choice.Service:- The service was very attentive and gave us great recommendationsAmbiance - Cool, farm-to-table hipster modern vibe.  I feel like there are so many places with this ambiance that I would have liked something a little warmer because I do feel like the food at True Food is more upscale than Lyfe but the ambiance is very similar.","2/12/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=N1YNx_cUvShIB_YkVzm9iQ","Addy B."

The space is enormous and very pretty! We got seated right away and our waitress started taking our drink orders just a couple of minutes later. We shared one appetizer and the main dish. Instead of bringing additional dishes, the food came already divided- which I thought was very nice. We had the Moroccan Lentil Soup (Daily market Soup), the Herb Hummus and the Spicy Panag Curry...Everything was incredibly flavorful and ultra fresh!

Probably the best pizza I've ever had. There is a wonderful array of flavors, my favorite being the smoked onion.

"My best mate was in town for the weekend, and having had a great experience at True Food in ATL, highly recommended we go for Sunday eats.Love the big airy space, all the cutie pie girls and boys working, with a fun attitude to match. We started with the cauliflower which was superb, a bit creamy, tangy, with just enough caramelization. Doubling that order with some protein on the side would make for a great dinner.I had the avocado toast (yeah, yeah, yeah, I know). I liked that the bread was thinner than you usually get, and the gouda held everything together nicely. Topped by two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs, it made for a filling and healthy Sunday nosh.We passed on the cocktails (hungover from the usual Boystown shenanigans) opting for iced green tea instead.

"I am so disappointed. The TFK restaurants I've been to in California offer the most bountiful beautiful inspiring bowl of crudités-- so much so that I remember and look forward to returning whenever I'm in LA. It's $14 for a large and $9 for a small, but it's always been worth it. For this reason, I was excited to hear they were opening in Chicago.  Upon arrival, I ordered the crudités--excited--and the meal stopped there. What arrived was a bowl of ice cubes with a with a few stray vegetables on top. It felt like I was so late to the wedding, I'd missed the hors d'oevres.  Take a look at the pictures below. Did someone drop broccoli on the ice sculpture? More important: Did my memory deceive me? I texted my LA sister a picture to ask if I'd lost my mind; she insisted there had to be a mistake. I searched the Internet for images only to find validation. So I asked my waitress who called Iver the manager. The manager's reply?  She told me she plans speak to corporate because plainly some stores are not adhering to corporate standards!!! I pleaded with her not to do so--did she have to ruin it for everyone? She had no answer for the plethora of similarly adoring images all over the Internet other than to repeat that she intended to speak to corporate. Brilliant. Give that woman a raise. She offered a refund, but I don't want freebies. I want a beautiful, lovely, bountiful, inspiringly arranged bowl of mouthwatering veggies and a reason to return in the future with friends who will be similarly enthralled with a unique find. But I can't do that because for $9-14, I think it's fair to say the portion was microscopic (maybe Produce at Whole Foods was on strike?) and the uninspired crudités  aesthetic enough to give me a chemical depression. Without bounty and natural food beauty, TFK is just another soulless chain on an already bleak landscape to this consumer. I'm more an indie kind of consumer, but truly, I was sad.","12/15/2016","1.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=T8CdMdHYpYQ_p612rG5mJg","L H."

"There was a long wait to get a table. There was even a lady at the door telling people about a 45 minute wait...for lunch. Luckily I was alone and found a seat at the bar with no extra wait. After waiting for some time, I had to get the attention of the waitress who then cleared the space in front of me with dishes and gave me a menu. I saw several things that I liked which is good so I asked for recommendations from the waitress. She said the seasonal ingredient salad and organic tuscan kale were good with protein. I ended up getting the teriyaki quinoa bowl with the grass-fed steak. I also ordered the aquanaut moonray porter---$30. Tasted good but in my opinion a little pricey. I am going to have to go again to try some of the things she recommended...but sparingly.","12/16/2016","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iluhUML2Uf8ubwJG4riUtQ","David C."
"I'm torn. I came here extremely excited since I've been to true foods in Arizona and loved it!! Needless to say when true foods showed up in chicago I was very happy! It had been a while since I had their food so I looked up a few reviews for items to order for carry out. Verdict below. Matcha horchata 3.5/5 - a little too sweet but some may like it this way. It could do with more concentrated matcha flavor and less milk. I probably won't order this again.Steak tacos 5/5 - really enjoyed this dish but the portion size was so small - think kid size :( I think three tacos would have been perfect but it only comes with two and a very modest size of steak. The ingredients tastes fresh and well put together! (Even for carry out!) Kale salad (1/5) - okay I love kale salad but this was completely inedible. The salad was over salted and had too much vinegar/ dressing. I took 1.5 bites and couldn't finish the rest. So sad. I asked my husband to try it and he said it's the kind of food you take one bite and have to walk away for 15 minutes to reset your palette. What?! Who eats like that?? Miserable. I love the kale salad at Siena Tavern and this was such a departure from any kind of kale salad I ever had. I was upset this food was wasted because I couldn't even swallow another bite of it.   The food is pretty expensive so I was disappointed that this was not the quality I expected for the value.I want to come back for brunch on the weekend and try some other dishes like ancient grains. I hope to experience the 5 star quality like the other reviewers soon.","12/3/2016","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XvDCc88bf48VumWuVchl0A","Ann L."

Some may think the portion sizes were slightly on the smaller side, but I thought they were good for a light lunch.  Reasonably priced as well. Service: The service was wonderful.

"True Food had only been open a week before we tried it this past Saturday night, so I was expecting some issues.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much went well.  We stopped in Saturday night (w/o a reservation) and were seated quickly.  I will say it quickly filled up and I can see the place getting very popular.We started with the Kale Guacamole and that was one dish that we didn't really care for.  I liked the pita chips, but I felt the Guac needed a little something else - maybe a spice?For drinks, my husband got the Citrus Skinny Margarita and to me it was delicious and sort of like a mojito with the mint in there.For entrees, we got the Red Chili Noodles w/ Shrimp and the Spicy Panang Curry w/ Shrimp.  I loved the curry a lot, and my husband really liked the noodles.  We love spice and the curry pleasantly had a good spice.  I would definitely get either dish again.We finished with the Gobi Apple Crisp and it was very good - we quickly ate that dish up.As for atmosphere and wait staff.  Both were on par with the night and very beautiful and attentive, respectively.I definitely see myself returning in the near future as I think this place is real find.","11/30/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CxxPUsjExKIQWu7I_XTJug","Jennifer G."

"It is true that True Food Kitchen feels like eating in a chain restaurant- even if is a decidedly chic, ecologically friendly chain restaurant. But you're likely to forgive that because the food is so good.  The best of the appetizers is the charred cauliflower (served with dates, dill, mint and pistachio).  The oversized pizzas are generally quite tasty- the butternut squash comes with a vegan ricotta that has a surprisingly rich almondy taste, which goes well with the smoked onion heaped on the dough.  I preferred the chicken sausage pizza because that chicken sausage has a seriously smoky taste that makes the pizza memorable.  Lunch for 2 came to $43.","2/20/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cYjzLu3fm-VbtjRMCuhK6Q","Jennifer N."

"Food here is super fresh and healthy. Only reason it's gets 4 stars is that it's on the expensive side for the portions. Started off with the roasted cauliflower, edemame dumplings, and torched avocado. All 3 where great, light, and flavorful. Had the steak tacos, only 2 of them and they were So-so. My sister had the 7 grain bowl with steak which was prob best dish of whole table. Wife had the seasonal salad which good but portion was real small, even for her, and that's coming from a 110lb girl.

I am so happy that I did!I had the cauliflower soup, panang curry with shrimp we decided to share the squash pie for dessert. My friend had the Brussel sprouts and the butternut squash pizza.  We shared a little bit of each other's food. Everything was delicious! The soup was perfect on a cold night. It had a nice flavor with just enough spice. I really enjoyed the curry. The pizza was very tasty. I would of never thought of squash pie it was awesome.

"I LOVED true food kitchen. Being able to go out to eat and not feeling terrible the next day about the food choices you made at dinner...a great feeling! They offer very healthy choices that are a unique blend of flavors and ingredients, but still very delicious. As soon as we walked in, I noticed how spacious the restaurant was. When we immediately walked in, they have a small herb garden. Half the restaurant is bright and well light, and the other half is slightly dimmer. All the food we had was delicious and I can't wait to be back to try more items on the menu (I love that 80% of the menu is vegetarian friendly). Veggie Crudite: 3/5 - essentially just organic vegetables, but only reason I loved this dish was because of the black olive dip (I usually hate olives, but this dip was delicious). Next time, I'd see if I could just get the dip, cause without it, it is essentially just vegetables on ice. Edamame Dumplings: 5/5 - These were delicious! They were light and flavorful. Charred cauliflower: 5/5 - I really liked these! Very flavorful, cauliflower was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Brussel sprout and wild mushroom pizza: 3/5 - I really liked the pizza; the only reason I took off a couple stars is because it didn't seem like a very unique dish. It tasted pretty standard and there weren't many brussel sprouts on our pizza. Spaghetti squash casserole: 3/5 - This is probably the only dish I wouldn't reorder or want to reorder. It was definitely a healthier alternative to pasta noodles, however in comparison to the other dishes it didn't taste as flavorful. Ancient Grains Bowl w/Tofu: 5/5 - The sweet potato with the teriyaki sauce was BOMB DOT COM! It was really flavorful with their homemade teriyaki sauce, the sweet potatoes were so soft it's like they melted in your mouth. The mushrooms were so well cooked and flavored; it went perfect with the green sauce. I wish they offered this as takeout so I could take it for lunch. The flourless chocolate cake was so yummy (I love chocolate so I may be biased). I will definitely be ordering this next time I'm there - you can also pick the flavor of the ice cream they serve with the cake. We got the mint chocolate chip (you can taste the fresh herbs in the ice cream). Overall, I can't wait to be back and try more items on the menu. The service was great and our waitress was a sweetheart - she was friendly, attentive and offered a lot of suggestions.","12/22/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-1_RJoRLeoDK3h_gNjf7UA","Priya S."

C'mon! Their honey lemonade tasted ""odd"" to me as well..and also ridiculous pricey. its lemon, water & honey- 5$!?!????  I only visited because i was given a giftcard.

"Service is awful. Staff seems pretty inexperienced.That aside, I love eating here. It is refreshing to have a restaurant in Chicago where you don't feel guilty after a meal. I like to think everything (or almost everything) here is healthy! My favorite item is the seasonal ingredient salad for lunch, which is also available with egg for brunch!I also came here recently for a Core Power Yoga/True Food Kitchen Vinyasa yoga + brunch event. It was a lot of fun and most of us stayed for brunch afterward.

"True food is a great healthy and vegan restaurant in Chicago. I found it on Yelp and decided to check it out. I ordered on grub hub after a long flight to town and was only disappointed by the absence of their dessert menu because their desserts sounded amazing!

"We stumbled upon this place through Yelp while visiting Chicago. My husband is a recent convert to veganism, and it has been difficult to find options while dining out.

"This was our first time at True Food kitchen and I found both the food and service mediocre. I had such high hopes because I love new healthy options. I had the chicken salad with manchego, apples, etc. but it tasted like something from Panera Bread. My husband got the grass fed burger and it lacked flavor.

"Finally!So here's this place, it is new and different with a touch of chic. It is a very hipster type of place. I love that the menu offers you modern variety on a 20-30 year old budget. In the loop/ river north area, it's not hard to find a restaurant with a pricey plate. What I love about True Food is that I'm eating real food, without pay an arm and a leg. And the options!!!! My husband brought me here for our date night and I was very pleased. We had the chicken sausage pizza with a side of roasted cauliflower. Both were amazing. I love that I didn't feel weighed down by the food once we were done eating. For my drink I tried the Matcha Horchata, it is like a heavenly mix between hot green tea, horchata, and a hint of vanilla! OMG you must have it. It is made with almond milk and I was very apprehensive about trying that as I do not typically prefer milk that comes from something other than a cow but this is worth venturing out for. If you don't get anything from True Food Kitchen, at least get one of these to go!","1/14/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_H78T8crtfTTpP5R_sR3xA","Taeler H."
"I went here on a Friday after work and I definitely recommend making a reservation because many people do and the place is packed on a Friday night.  I was lucky and arrived at 5:45pm right before the rush but the hosts were hesitant about whether or not they would have space for me with all of the reservations that were set up. We ordered the Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Ancient Grains Bowl, Spaghetti Squash Casserole, and the Red Moon specialty beverage, which was made from grapefruit, yuzu, and honey.  For dessert I had the Matcha Horchata.  Everything was very delicious and satisfying.  The food and drinks were made so that you could really taste the ingredients and enjoy them.  I could eat and drink everything I ordered everyday and not get tired of it. Our waiter was friendly and personable. I loved the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.  I will be returning.","2/18/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HXnoJkfqlQYSNtIUD4xXhA","Dana A."

Food was overpriced as well for the portions received. I got a bowl with shrimp and that was $20 and my brother in law got the burger ($17) and it was smaller then a McDonald's burger. Service was slow and spotty. We had to get our servers attention each time we needed him as he didn't come around very often.

"Whew! Where to start and what to say! Atmosphere is nice, clean, fresh & warm. Seated quickly. They do take reservations, which will probably be needed in a few months once the word gets out about this place. The food is off the hook!!!! Went with my son, so we split everything we ordered. Great selection of drinks had the Medicine man, great palate washer. Not too sweet with a hint of pomegranate.  The Honey bee ginger beer was teeming with ginger flavor and zest.Ordered the Butternut squash pizza as an appetizer. Indescribable! The flavors...the smokiness...the crisp on the outside crust done just right...the vegan almond ricotta... the onions....ohhhhhhh my! This is a definite MUST try! Onto our main dishes. We split two different dishes.The Ancient grains bowl...ohhhhhhh boy! The deliciousness of the miso glazed sweet potatoes, can I have just a plate of those please...what a combination of flavors this dish had. The sweetness of the miso glaze, mixed with a bit of heat, the crunching of the snow peas, the smokiness of the charred onions, mixed in with the avocado, and grains left our tongues tickled with flavor. The other plate we had was the TLT with sweet potato hash. The TLT bread had just the right amount of sweetness, toasted with just the right amount of crunch. The tempeh had a great smoked flavor,and the sandwich was stacked with butter lettuce, ripe tomatoes, avocado and vegan mayo. I have been looking for a good TLT sandwich for a while, this one hit the spot! And the sweet potato hash... with smoked onions... so good. Sweet potatoes were diced so there was no overpowering sweetness from the potatoes, just the right amount of salt made this an excellent choice for a side.We had room for dessert and ordered the Butternut squash pie with the matcha horchata. I am not a fan of matcha nor horchata but this drink made me one! The Butternut squash pie was the perfect ending to our meal. It sounds odd but was so good. A pretty decent sized slice too, topped with coconut whipped cream this was thoroughly enjoyed!My son was not big on eating vegan/vegetarian because most of the foods lack in flavor (according to him) this restaurant made a believer out of him. He enjoyed EVERYTHING and I did also. So much so that I went back tonight and ordered to go for my trip home!When you go there, ask for Jaboris he will take good care of you!","12/1/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NKi1vtRttr_YCOU51dKi-A","jl f."
"Excellent kitschy healthy.  Service was outstanding, very conscientious (I was on phone then business meeting). Cool vibe with a serious healthy but delicious bent on the menu.  Roasted cauliflower and albacore tuna was a great way to start. 'Seasonal Ingredient' salad was filling and very good...I didn't need the shrimp, in fact it was hard for the shrimp to outshine the horseradish vinaigrette and the greens. ) I'm not vegan or snooty when it comes to food...this was downright GOOD.","2/1/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OmnuEPnnfQCXPK3agW1C9A","Mark K."

"The food is incredibly tasty.  Like wow enjoyable.. BUT after eating here for the first time,  five out of six people in our group got severely sick,  including a 9-year-old child and 1-year-old baby.  Not sure if coincidentally it was a virus or what,  but hesitant to return to dine again unfortunately. Other experiences.. Our waitress was mediocre.  Didn't go out of her way to be extra friendly or helpful.  We had several different staff members helping our table.  Also,  no tea refills,  which is a shame.  What I remember ordering is the hummus with fresh veggies, edamame, kale salad with salmon,  child's pizza,  child's burger,  the brussels sprouts salad with horseradish dressing and added salmon,  and dessert (apple pie and chocolate cake, which was supposed to be free for the birthday we celebrated,  but we were charged anyway grrr). A positive thing about the Desserts is that they are all dairy and gluten free!! So neat.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Still,  like I said,  we are cautious to eat it again.  Added up very quickly.  Probably about 300 bucks.","1/28/2017","3.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UBuosIMM5GT1HfHagrZKKw","Stephanie P."

"I've been looking forward to this True Food Kitchen opening for a loooong time. Seriously, it took them over a year to put up the building and build out the restaurant which is insanely slow. Now, having been there twice, I don't think I'll return. The food is... okay I guess? That's  about as much as I can muster. So far we've tried the guacamole, edamame dumplings, Asian bowl, turkey burger, lasagna and chocolate cake. Edamame dumplings are a stand out. Definitely delicious. Turkey burger was REALLY dry and bland. I also requested a GF bun which was a $2.50 upcharge. Not that big of a deal but our server didn't mention it when ordering or when she dropped off the bill. Lasagne bolognese might be the saltiest dish that I've ever had at a restaurant. My face puckered when at the first bite and I only had a few bites in total. That was enough though as my partner and I couldn't sleep later in the night because we had stomach cramps. We both eat really healthy and don't have any digestive issues, so I'm not 100% sold on the health claims of the menu.The other issue is the servers. The staff is really nice and seems to be trying their best, but both of our servers just seemed over their head. They would forget items and didn't seem to understand the menu. I don't actually feel that it's their fault, though. The restaurant drops off a pamphlet about non-imflammatory diets and they seem to think that substitutes staff training. A few tweaks of the menu and some enhanced staff training might bring this place up to par.","12/19/2016","2.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Sb3TelcLN4t355ram39vxA","MIke F."
"My new favorite place in Chicago. (This is what Beatrix and Lyfe Kitchen should aim to match.) Great food selection. I do wish they offered sugar free drinks and desserts for people on paleo or low carb diets.My favorites are their 1) Charred Cauliflower 2) Tuscan Kale 3) Kale Guacamole 4) Edamame Dumplings 5) Mushroom Pizza 6) Steak Tacos. I do have a request for management - please include more organic selections for produce. I only see the word organic in a couple of places in the menu (Tuscan Salad). Many organic produce items are not significantly more expensive than conventional produce these days. So please switch to organic and specify in the menu.

Again everything was made to perfection. Their menu is great for vegetarians,vegans and meat eaters. So if you are vegan and your friends are tired of only going to vegan restaurants with you please bring them here because there is something delicious for everyone.

"Came here after work for dinner and could not have been more impressed. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was just down right delicious. My friend and I split the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with Chicken Sausage with an order of roasted Brussels sprouts. The meal was completely filling and surprisingly guilt free (major win!).I would recommend True Food Kitchen to anyone and can't wait to go back and taste more of their tempting menu offers.","12/26/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uxCXODP2Davq20rC3fbcmQ","Heather W."
"Ate here in Phoenix two years ago and was happy to see it open near us here. Varied menu. All three of us liked our entrees: a salad, wrap and bowl. A bit pricey but worth it. Service friendly and efficient. Highly recommended.","12/11/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qlIGx7mneB-FFh30Zk2IeA","Brule L."

"UPDATE: one of the business owners, Christine, sent me an email regarding my post. She immediately offered me an apology and requested that I call her and speak with her directly. She and I played ""tag"" but finally connected. Christine listened intently to what had occurred and took full responsibility for the situation and her staff member. I believe she really was embarrassed and upset with my experience. She again offered her most sincere apologies and asked that I give TFK another chance. She went on to say she had not yet spoken with the hostess who I had had the altercation with but she would be doing so in the next day or so. She also said she had yet to work with this hostess and would also be doing that, she stated she likes to work with all the employees to see how they interact, conduct themselves, etc. I told her how much I appreciated her true concern as well as her apology and I said I would absolutely come back in for another meal. Because of her business acumen and respect for her clientele I decided to move this review up in the number of stars I awarded.","2/13/2017Updatedreview","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KGYXIQgXIzuIIiT-l3klhg","Anna S."
"I write reviews either when i really think a place or person stands out or when something was terrible. This is the latter. I appreciate the ""anti-inflammatory "" diet but my appreciation stops there.  Checked in for reservations at 6, so not very busy yet.   hostess very nice. But she kept looking for her counterpart to seat us. After 5mins of standing there she finally just sat us since her colleague never came back.  Thus, left door unattended while others were coming in.  Once seated, 5-10 mins before anyone came to offer drinks/water.  Two servers came but never got their names.  Not sure who was training whom until we completed order.   Then female waitstaff speaks up to ask how kids' burgers shld be cooked and what side other order wanted.   After apps, male waiter and busboy cleared plates.  Waiter said he wld bring my kids new utensils, never did; I had to ask female waiter during entrees since kid cldnt eat yet.  Busboy cleared app plates over my head, plates shifted and I reacted like they wld drop on  me.  He explained twice how that cld never happen but he never apologized. Regardless,  who removes plates over a patron's head?!!   Entrees came in timely manner and kitchen did good job but only confirmed not busy yet. Never was chked on afterward even tho sat right in front of kitchen window so cld see our waitstaff the entire time.  Had to wave one down to ask for condiments,  aforementioned utensils, and water refills when glasses completely empty.  Again, there were 2 of them!  By the way, don't get the lasagna. Spinach was not cooked consistently, crunchy on some bites, soggy on others. Way too salty.

"After falling in love with True Food in Scottsdale I waited 2 years for this restaurant to come to Chicago. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!Today I brought a friend for her birthday and we were both wowed by every single thing:Cauliflower:  Scrumptious!  tasty sauce and done just rightBrussels Sprouts:  Wowee!  And such a lovely compliment to the cauliflower.Chopped Chicken Salad:  very goodSeasonal Vegetable salad with Steelhead Salmon:  Oh gosh, we drifted into a dream....Kale Ade drink and Kombucha Ade, both tops.All in all, its the one restaurant in chicago where I don't have to sacrifice health to have a wonderful and exciting dining experience.  Its a bit out of the way for me, but so so worth it.  Abovementioned friend and I agreed to make this a monthly date and to go through the whole menu.  See you on Wednesdays!!","12/14/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OFZM90zyLmYgv9Jz2a-YUA","linda m."
"Excellent.  As a vegetarian,  most restaurants offer one entrée as a choice. Not True Food K Kitchen. They have a good variety and when I asked our waiter if their vegetarian burger was fried or grilled near the rest of the burgers they said ""no, it is not"" so they're very conscious of how vegetarians feel.   I had the ancient grains and took home leftovers.  I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers and can't wait to go back,","2/17/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YhgHlxBZnFzX7tU4VmKX3Q","Kathy R."

"My friend from South Carolina was visiting and we decided to check out True Foods on a recommendation from a friend. I'm not usually one to frequent ""organic"" or otherwise fru-fru restaurants, though I have been pleasantly surprised by a few.I got there before my friend and was promptly greeted with a smile and told that I would be seated momentarily. I took the opportunity to gaze around the space, and it's airy and sits somewhere between casual and elegant. I was walked past the open kitchen to my table, and I realized that the place is bigger than it looked like from outside. The table was set with plate, flatware, cloth napkin and wineglass.When my friend arrived, we were waited upon by Julia, who did a very good job of recommending items on the menu. We split a nice bottle of the Spanish Tempranillo and shared an appetizer of albacore tataki that melted in our mouths like butter. The thinly sliced jalapeno gave just the hint of a kick and really made the dish pop.We both asked for the lasagna bolognese because neither of us was willing to back down on our first choice and order something different for the sake of diversity. And neither of us was disappointed. Yes, it's a gluten free pasta, but I didn't miss the gluten at all. Nor did I miss the pork, as the chicken sausage was perfect in this dish. It was absolutely delicious. The only thing missing was a piece of bread to help sop up the remaining bit of the sauce. But perhaps that would mess up the gluten-freeness of the entree. For dessert, I chose an apple/goji berry crisp a la mode. Perfect, as the crust was made of crushed nuts instead of a flour-based crust.I give True Food Kitchen high marks for the quality of the food, the very friendly service, and the ambience. I'll be telling my friends.","12/4/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5qwhGTFpeoO0wESrQJBVpA","Unknown C."
"LOVED EVERYTHING! I stopped by one afternoon initially just to look over the menu and ended up getting some ginger tea that was outstanding. I came back the same day for dinner and had the halibut appetizer (melted in my mouth), the lasagna bolognese (excellent and filling without being heavy), some Spanish red wine, and the flourless chocolate cake (phenomenal, soft and most). Our server, Julia, was knowledgeable and charming! You should definitely check this place out!","11/29/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yQwPHR3vYw53wbMIpkXRxQ","Nathan B."
"If you're looking for a light, healthy meal, this place is just the ticket. True Food is very reasonably priced and has a large menu of creative healthy options for any meal. The interior feels very fresh and clean. The food has also clearly been carefully thought out, as the options are extensive for that of a restaurant considered to he selling ""healthy food."" The only disappointment I had was in their juice selection. They have a large variety of healthy drinks, but some are just naturally sweetened teas whether than a larger large juice and smoothie section.","2/23/2017","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mRQs1tbpG8qnC7z3qFKP9A","Rebecca W."
"True Food Kitchen is a diamond among pearls in the downtown Chicago culinary scene. They've taken the challenge of cleaning up your diet for you and make it seem effortless. Forget the vegan cafes and bland preconceived notions, the food is delicious and the staff knows it inside and out. Whether you have diet restrictions or care about eating clean, give this a try, your body will thank you. Jon took great care of me, but honestly every server who touched the table was friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about the company and the concept. I'm moving to Florida soon and will miss this place immensely. Open one in Orlando soon!","11/26/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fCCvnFrb_N5leDED9-2GFA","Blake H."
"A great option for those looking for healthier options or just great food.  We went for the third or fourth time last night and it's getting busier each time we visit. Two of us around 630pm on Friday night and we waited 10 minutes.   My favorite is the seasonal salad in the horseradish dressing.  Tons of roasted veggies, a bit of grain and toasted mulberries add the perfect crunch and sweetness. Pizza is great too.","2/11/2017","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cv8HK2g9mRDbNQjmkfgVMw","Sammie M."
"Love this place! Ive been to the Santa Monica and Phoenix locations and was so excited that they opened one in Chicago! The food is delicious and so vegan friendly!! I had the butternut squash vegan pizza and the vegan tlt (tempeh lettuce tomato),  both were so fresh and flavorful and so good! So happy they have vegan cheese too! Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu as well.  The service was great too.  Also a majority of their desserts are vegan -  I had the butternut squash pie with coconut cream,  which is divine!","12/17/2016","5.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CDiG3f0rHjP3ecDKaA4l-g","P S."

"Tasty food, good quality. But this restaurant has definitely been skimping on the portion sizes! The large veggie crudités appetizer is now smaller than what the small size used to be (and the prices haven't decreased). The menu offers a good selection, but I wish the restaurant wasn't decreasing their portion sizes. Will hurt them from retaining customers.","12/28/2016","4.0 star rating","https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ru5E0uJMwU0cj3plIdwe7A","Kristin S."

"Delicious. Love that it has so many tasty vegetarian options that taste fresh and well made. We shared the dumplings and lettuce cups, chili noodles & seasonal vegetable plate (which was especially good). The drinks were amazing - esp the pomegranate mule-smooth and not too sweet, even my husband's bourbon based drink was good to me. The service was excellent-wish I could remember her name- she was awesome!
