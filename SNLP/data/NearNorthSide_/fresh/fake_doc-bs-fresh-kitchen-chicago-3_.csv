"Does the ""B's"" in Doc B's stand for balls?  Because thats what this food tasted like. We got it delivered through Grubhub and it showed up 2 hours late cold as hell.  My girlfriend was so disgusted by this that i got zero action from her that night.  I also had to watch Parenthood with her because she was so upset instead of the Big Ten Championship.  Not mad about it though, Ray Romano has transitioned nicely over to drama.","3/16/2014","1.0 star rating","XSao24D1-siejKQVZBNbEQ","Steve G."
"unbelievably overpriced.  Just ordered a grilled chicken salad and literally needed a microscope to find the chicken, which consisted of about an oz of dry, chopped, extremely salty cubes of chicken buried in an overwhelming pile of sprint mix that looked like it was purchased at Trader Joes.  I was starving before I went in and now i'm still starving and angry because I just spend $14.00 for lettuce. I was looking forward to trying a new eatery in the neighborhood but recommend that if you want a good meal for that price, skip Doc Bs and go to the Indian place next door.","10/7/2013","1.0 star rating","QmyXWcLYgd_i6Zd-pToOSg","K B."
"I am going to make this quick. I am new to Chicago and this is my first review. I stopped in a few days ago and this was my impression: The food is ok, but overpriced. The service was pleasant, but everyone seemed stressed, Overall experience was less than average. I got the impression that they opened before they were ready. I would wait a month then see where they are at.","9/23/2013","1.0 star rating","l98-bJCEOvQ-yN2P2ZanNg","Johnny V."
"I was pretty disappointed in the food here. The ambiance is cool but that's about it. Service sucked. She wasn't remotely friendly until it was time for a tip, then once she got it she was back to ignoring me. Pan seared chicken was not good, the potatoes were ok and the French Toast Crunch Cheesecake sucked. One highlight was the chips and guacamole, very good!","5/12/2016","2.0 star rating","kbFebt6nf-WirNO6iFiG2A","Michele m."
"Low quality food in a high rent area. If you are visiting Chicago for the first time, do not let this establishment be your first experience. There is so much more to explore.

"Came here for the first time together with friends and we really enjoyed our first time dining experience here. We've got the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the Corn Chowder, really good in portions and very delectable, we love it. Our simple meal was so satisfying. We tried also the Salmon Wok Bowl w/ Lo Mein and Spicy Sauce.- worth dying for. Love it! It's cooked perfectly. The service was amazing, friendly and nice staffs are very accommodating us. We love both service and food. We really enjoyed them! Decided to come back here next time to try some of their menus.","9/8/2016","4.0 star rating","rougx3FgDm3mK9xKkqwReg","Barbie S."

"Doc B's always hits the spot. I always get the Wok Out Bowl with salmon and it never disappoints. Salads are top notch too. Super fresh ingredients and good service in a nice chill atmosphere. Good for carry out as well. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's a little on the pricey side for what it is.","8/12/2014","4.0 star rating","A1Iu8uTdjxK4VBiqWwlByw","Lucas M."

Once we sat down the staff was very professional and helpful even with a nice busy buzz about the place. We didn't want for anything! Wok bowl was a nice touch and salads were fresh and great flavor!

"Went here the Monday after Lollapalooza looking for a fresh and yummy meal and got exactly what I wanted. I ordered the matzoh ball soup to start and the  salmon with parmesan broccoli as my main dish. Both were absolutely delicious, and I loved the sauce that came with my salmon. I was in a group with 6 others, and at the end of our meal we asked her to give us separate checks, and she was great about doing so.

"Had to grab a quick lunch and Doc Bs was close and convenient. Atmosphere was good and first greeted by our server Jasmine. She was absolutely the best and made the whole experience superb. Jasmine started off with explaining the days specials and answered all of our questions concerning the menu, then gave us input and recommendations that were spot on. My wife and I shared the Tangle Noodle salad and the Dragon burger. The noodles in the salad were absolutely amazing. The salad was large portion and full of all ingredients listed, very flavorful and would most definitely  have again.The Dragon burger was spectacular. Hands down one of the best tasting burgers I've had, and I'm talking just the meat alone. The burger came piled high with a mound of French fried onions and a slaw with just the right spice that didn't over power the awesome tasting burger patty.My wife had the Paloma cocktail, a fine mix of avion tequila, grapefruit and lime. I had a taste and we both agreed the drink was very well done.Doc Bs was excellent in every way, from Jasmine's excellent service to the outstanding lunchtime meal. I would absolutely return next time in town.","7/10/2016","5.0 star rating","smg4mElUvkFszfWHcUQ84w","Doug N."
