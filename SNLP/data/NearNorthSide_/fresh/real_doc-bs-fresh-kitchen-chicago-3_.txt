I have tried the quinoa bowl, salad with tuna, and most recently the chicken bowl with cashew and hot Thai sauce. \u00a0It was incredibly flavorful and satisfying without feeling too heavy and also healthy.When it comes to dining in, I actually dread it a little because it becomes so incredibly packed and waiting for a table is not the most pleasant experience especially on weekends.

I had the gumbo to start followed by the Cobb salad. The gumbo was heavy on the gravy taste, and light on the authentic NOLA experience, it was still very tasty though so don't be deterred just don't order it because you \"love gumbo\". The Cobb salad was legitimately one of the best salads I ever had, the accompanying honey fried chicken was a great touch too and it actually tasted healthy! Much more deliciously lightly breaded than actually fried.The honey vinaigrette was also amazing! It was a perfect portion as well. The service was prompt and very friendly.

Get there, order is ready, I pay, all good. I make the 3 minute walk back to my room. This is when things deteriorate. I pile up the egg, candied bacon, and tomato/lettuce and bite into the wedge burger. Pretty tasty. Kind of cold though. I then look at the inside of the burger and see dark red.

I was excited to come back based on my first experience but the service was so poor this time (especially the hostess) that I will probably not go back to this location. Also, the portion size seems significantly smaller. The food is on the pricey side. I brought my sister who has a disability for lunch because I had a very positive first experience. My second experience was the exact opposite. There were lots of people at 1pm on a Friday. We were told the wait would be about 15 - 20 minutes. After putting my name on the list, we waited about 35 minutes and watched 3 groups go ahead of us. The hostess and people at the counter/cash register were not friendly. They glared at us, seemed to be talking about us, and seated us in the back of the restaurant. I wonder if they were discriminating because of my sister's disability. The review by Jessica P. said you can order while you wait. After waiting about 30 minutes, I asked the hostess if we could place our order so our food would be ready when our table was, and she said she could not do this since she did not know when we would be seated. She then told me to put my name on the list. I told her I already did, at which point she said we were next, and that the people at the table we would be seated at had paid and were leaving. (So she did know when we would be seated and she did not want to serve us.) After we were seated, we ordered the turkey burger with quinoa and the carnitas sandwich with fries. The service was fast - our food came out in about 10-15 minutes. The turkey burger was unfortunately extremely dry and not very flavorful. I did enjoy the quinoa salad which had mint in it and the carnitas sandwich (which looked more like a burger). The fries were ok.The carnitas sandwich was the best part of our experience. That and the fact that we shared the rest of our meal with a homeless man who was hungry. Overall, they are not very friendly to people with disabilities. I guess if you and your party do not have disabilities, this would not be an issue. Also, I mentioned this in the tips but the accessible entrance is very roundabout. You do not use their entrance, you use the one to the left of theirs. There is an elevator, which you take to the first floor. Then you go down a long yellow, empty hallway and their door is marked Doc B's on the right.

It was pretty good. Nothing mind-blowing, nothing terrible. Just a-ok.One of the confusing aspects comes int he form of who is serving what and when. We had a guy ask us for our drink orders, two guys as our servers, and one woman who brought drinks. I hope they share tips.My wife ordered the steak frites which our waiter suggested being cooked to medium. It came out WELL-DONE. And the portion was quite small for the price ($26.) She expected leftovers for the next day, but that plate was well-cleaned with no overs whatsoever.I had the fried chicken sandwich with couscous as a side. Very tasty. Chicken had just the right amount of crunch and I enjoyed the simple flavors of pickle, onion and thousand island dressing. The couscous tasted lemony and fresh. Delicious. I was a little tiffed when a woman sat down next to us and was offered water - still, sparkling or bottled. We weren't offered ANY water, let alone sparkling on tap! Boo to you, waiters/drinks dude.

The chicken is far better and you'll drop all of $14.How this place gets 4.5 stars is just beyond comprehension.For the record: The Tennessee Hot Chicken was anything but hot and pretty greasy.

Also very fresh, handcut, crisped perfectly, and they have some sort of herb mixture sprinkled on top. When mixed with the honey mustard, it was just the perfect addition to the sandwich.

Given our time constraint as we had to get back to class and the fact that my waitress wasn't even refilling my water even after I asked, I didn't say anything about the burger. Within thirty minutes of getting back, I felt nauseous and had to leave class during opening arguments to throw up. I still didn't say anything, until I really just couldn't sit still anymore. I couldn't concentrate in the group discussion that we had, so again I had to leave the room to throw up. I finally called and asked to speak to the manager, but he was extremely rude and condescending. He made it seem like I was lying, and somehow he was absolutely sure that the turkey patty was cooked properly. I don't know how someone can be so sure that each piece meat, especially poultry, \u00a0is cooked properly unless he was the chef that cooked my specific patty himself.

The sandwich was amazing, had my tastebuds singing!

Though the burger was good, my bottom half of the bun was completely soggy from the grease and started to disintegrate when I picked it up. \u00a0It was so unappetizing that I ended up not eating it at all. \u00a0Also, the french fries were terrible. \u00a0They were overcooked, soggy and tasteless. \u00a0It was probably the first meal I have had where I completely abandoned my fries. \u00a0My husband ordered the turkey burger with avocado, \u00a0roasted red pepper & tortilla strips with avocado vinaigrette. \u00a0He enjoyed his burger and the sweet potato fries he chose. \u00a0He didn't seem to have any of the problems I did with my meal.The atmosphere is weird. \u00a0It almost gives off a fancy fast food vibe with the huge lighted up billboard like menu \u00a0right when you walk in. \u00a0IF you aren't paying close attention, you'd get the impression that you place your order before being seated. \u00a0However, if you're dining in, you are able to order with your server at the table. \u00a0My other complaint is that with Fresh Kitchen in the name, I expect FRESH ingredients. \u00a0I didn't get that impression from any of the things I ordered. \u00a0The food was good, but for the price, \u00a0and execution of dishes there are better options in the Gold Coast and surrounding areas.", "review_rating": "2.0 star rating"}, {"review_date": "5/4/2016", "user_name": "Jackie W.", "user_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ivPZFrK2DPNsAmhKQCP8Ow", "review": "Very good food! \u00a0I ordered the Cobb salad and it was delicious, and the chicken was melt in my mouth with a delicious crunch.

Music was techno when we were there (boom boom boom), though not too loud. Lighting is decent.SERVICE: Friendly server, attentive and informative.GOOD: Frites seemed manufactured, but stayed crispy through the meal. Trout special was a bit dry, but was fresh and tasty.
